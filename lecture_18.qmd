Harmonic waves are not localised in $x$. Instead they are periodic in $x$ and
keep repeating infinitely. However, it is possible to construct a localised
_wave packet_ by summing up harmonic waves with different wave numbers. So,
let's consider the wave given by
$$
y(x,t)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}A(k) e^{i(kx - \omega(k)t)} dk.
$$ {#eq-packet00}
Note how we are integrating over all wave numbers from $-\infty$ to $\infty$.
There is of course no guarantee that such an integral would give a finite
result unless the coefficient function $A(k)$ is chosen carefully to fall off
sufficiently quickly towards positive and negative infinity. Rather than 
discussing the general theory, which you may already have met in a module on
functional analysis, we are going to look at the most important example: the
Gaussian wave packet.

## Gaussian wave packet
Let
$$
A(k)=e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$ {#eq-packet000}
for some real $k_0$ and positive $\sigma$. This function has a single peak at
$k=k_0$ and rapidly decays to zero away from it. The parameter $\sigma$ is
approximately the 'half width' of the peak. The sketch of this function is shown
in @fig-gauss a).

To understand what this wave packet looks like in space, we first look at $t=0$,
where we have
$$
y(x,0)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, e^{ikx} dk.
$$ {#eq-packet0}
To perform the integral we use a trick called "completing the
square" whereby we move all $k$ dependence into the square in the exponential.
So we rewrite the exponent as follows:
$$
-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}+ikx = -\frac{(k-k_0-ix\sigma^2)^2}{2\sigma^2}+ik_0x-\frac{x^2\sigma^2}{2}.
$$
Using this in @eq-packet0  gives
$$
y(x,0)=e^{-\frac{x^2\sigma^2}{2}}e^{ik_0x}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left(-\frac{(k-k_0-ix\sigma^2)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \,  dk.
$$ {#eq-packet1}
The integral over the Gaussian simply gives $\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma$, so that we have the solution
$$
y(x,0)=\sqrt{2\pi} \, \sigma \, \exp\left(-\frac{\sigma^2 x^2}{2}\right)
e^{ik_0 x} .
$$ {#eq-packet3}
The factor $e^{ik_0 x}$ represents a harmonic wave, the other factors represent
a varying amplitude (the envelope of the wave). The graph of the real part of
@eq-packet3 is shown in @fig-gauss b.

Note that the half width of the wave packet is $1/\sigma$, i.e. it is inversely
proportional to the width of $A(k)$. This means that that a more localised wave
corresponds to a broader range in $k$ and vice versa. This property has an
important consequence in quantum mechanics -- the uncertainty principle.

## Moving wave packets and group velocity

If we have the standard wave equation, so that $\omega(k) = c\,k$ with a
constant $c$ (no dispersion), then, according to
@eq-packet00, we have $y(x,t)=f(x-ct)$ where $f(x)=y(x,0)$ is given by
@eq-packet3. Thus, if there is no dispersion, the wave packet propagates with
the (constant) wave speed $c$ without changing its initial form.

The situation becomes more interesting if there is dispersion, i.e., if
$\omega(k)/k$ depends on $k$. If we assume that $A(k)$ is well localised, i.e.
$\sigma$ is sufficiently small, then only values of $k$ in a small neighbourhood
of $k_0$ will contribute to the integral given by @eq-packet00. With this in
mind, we replace $\omega(k)$ with its Taylor expansion about $k=k_0$, keeping
only two nonzero terms, i.e.
$$
\omega(k)=\omega_0 + \alpha (k-k_0) + O(\vert k-k_0\vert^2),
$$
where
$$
\omega_0=\omega(k_0), \quad \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dk}(k_0).
$$
Then @eq-packet00 with $A(k)$ given by @eq-packet00 yields
$$\begin{split}
y(x,t)&\approx \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}+i(kx-\omega_0 t -\alpha(k-k_0)t)} \, dk \\
&= e^{-i(\omega_0-\alpha k_0 )t} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \,  e^{ik(x-\alpha t)} \, dk .
\end{split}$$
We notice that the integral is similar to the one in @eq-packet0 , just with $x$
replaced by $x-\alpha t$, so we can reuse the result from the previous section.
In view of @eq-packet3, we obtain
$$
y(x,t)\approx\sqrt{2\pi} \, \sigma \, e^{-\frac{\sigma^2 (x-\alpha t)^2}{2}}
e^{i(k_0 x -\omega_0 t)}.
$$ {#eq-packet3b}

The factor $e^{i(k_0 x -\omega_0 t)}$ represents a harmonic wave travelling with
the wave speed $c=\omega_0/k_0$, while the other factors give us the envelope
of the wave. Now, however, that envelope propagates not with the wave speed $c$ but with
the __group velocity__ $c_g$ where
$$
c_g=\alpha=\frac{d\omega}{dk}(k_0).
$$
In general, the group velocity is different from the wave speed. It is equal to
the wave speed only if there is no dispersion. 

In the wave packet in @eq-packet3b the shape of the envelope does not change
over time as the wave packet travels through space. However, if we keep the
quadratic term in the Taylor expansion of $\omega(k)$, we see that there are
some changes in the shape of the wave packet over time. The width of the
Gaussian envelope  will increase with time.

## Strange experiences of a water strider

Imagine a water strider sitting on the surface of a pond (a water strider is an insect that is light enough to be able to sit on water). It sees a wave packet approaching

We have derived in @sec-16 that the harmonic wave $\eta=A\cos(kx-\omega t)$ is
a solution describing a surface wave if $\omega=\pm\sqrt{g\,k}$. The wave moves with the
wave speed
$$
c = \frac{\omega}{k}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{g\lambda}{2\pi}}.
$$
We see that longer waves move faster than shorter waves.

We observed in the previous subsection that a wave packet with wave numbers 
localised around wave number $k$ moves with the group velocity
$$
c_g=\frac{d\omega}{dk}=\pm\frac12\sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}=\frac12 c.
$$
So for water waves the group velocity is half the phase velocity.
