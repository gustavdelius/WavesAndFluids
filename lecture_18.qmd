Harmonic waves are not localised in $x$ (rather, they are periodic in $x$). However, it is possible to construct a localised _wave packet_
by summing up harmonic waves with different wave numbers. So, let's consider the wave given by
$$
y(x,t)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}A(k) e^{i(kx - \omega(k)t)} dk.
$$ {#eq-packet00}

\noindent
__Gaussian wave packet:__ Let
$$
A(k)=e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$ {#eq-packet000}
for some real $k_0$ and positive $\sigma$. This function has a single peak at
$k=k_0$ and rapidly decays to zero away from it. The parameter $\sigma$ is
approximately the `half width' of the peak. The sketch of this function is shown
in @fig-gauss a).

At $t=0$, we have
$$
y(x,0)=\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, e^{ikx} dk.
$$ {#eq-packet0}
To perform the integral we are going to use a trick called "completing the
square" whereby we move all $k$ dependence into the square in the exponential.
So we rewrite the exponent as follows:
$$
-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}+ikx = -\frac{(k-k_0-ix\sigma^2)^2}{2\sigma^2}+ik_0x-\frac{x^2\sigma^2}{2}.
$$
Using this in @eq-packet0  gives
$$
y(x,0)=e^{-\frac{x^2\sigma^2}{2}}e^{ik_0x}\int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}\exp\left(-\frac{(k-k_0-ix\sigma^2)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \,  dk.
$$ {#eq-packet1}
The integral over the Gaussian simply gives $\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma$, so that we have the solution
$$
y(x,0)=\sqrt{2\pi} \, \sigma \, e^{-\frac{\sigma^2 x^2}{2}} \,
e^{ik_0 x} .
$$ {#eq-packet3}
The factor $e^{ik_0 x}$ represents a harmonic wave, the other factors represent a varying amplitude (the envelope of the wave).
The graph of the real part of @eq-packet3 is shown in @fig-gauss b.

Note that the half width of the wave packet is $1/\sigma$, i.e. it is inversely proportional to the width of $A(k)$. This means that
that a more localised wave corresponds to a broader range in $k$ and vice versa. This property has an important consequence in quantum mechanics --
the uncertainty principle.

## Moving wave packets and group velocity

If we have the standard wave equation, so that $\omega(k) = c\,k$ with a
constant $c$ (no dispersion), then, according to
@eq-packet00, we have $y(x,t)=f(x-ct)$ where $f(x)=y(x,0)$ is given by
@eq-packet3. Thus, if there is no dispersion, the wave packet propagates with
the (constant) wave speed $c$ without changing its initial form.

The situation becomes more interesting if there is dispersion, i.e., if
$\omega(k)/k$ depends on $k$. If we assume that $A(k)$ is well localised, i.e.
$\sigma$ is sufficiently small, then only values of $k$ in a small neighbourhood
of $k_0$ will contribute to the integral given by @eq-packet00. With this in
mind, we replace $\omega(k)$ with its Taylor expansion about $k=k_0$, keeping
only two nonzero terms, i.e.
$$
\omega(k)=\omega_0 + \alpha (k-k_0) + O(\vert k-k_0\vert^2), \quad \omega_0=\omega(k_0), \quad \alpha = \frac{d\omega}{dk}(k_0).
$$
Then @eq-packet00 with $A(k)$ given by @eq-packet00 yields
\begin{eqnarray}
y(x,t)&\approx& \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}+i(kx-\omega_0 t -\alpha(k-k_0)t)} \, dk 
\nonumber \\&=&
e^{-i(\omega_0-\alpha k_0 )t} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{(k-k_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \,  e^{ik(x-\alpha t)} \, dk .
%&=&e^{i(k_0 x -\omega_0 t)} \int\limits_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\frac{q^2}{2\sigma^2}} \,  e^{iq(x-\alpha t)} \, dq =
%e^{i(k_0 x -\omega_0 t)} I(x-\alpha t).   \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
We notice that the integral is similar to the one in @eq-packet0 , just with $x$ replaced by $x-\alpha t$,
so we can reuse the result from the previous section. In view of @eq-packet3, we obtain
$$
y(x,t)=\sqrt{2\pi} \, \sigma \, e^{-\frac{\sigma^2 (x-\alpha t)^2}{2}}
e^{i(k_0 x -\omega_0 t)}.
$$ {#eq-packet3b}
The factor $e^{i(k_0 x -\omega_0 t)}$ represents a harmonic wave travelling
with the wave speed $c_0=\omega_0/k_0$, while the other factors give us the envelope of the wave. Now, however,
it propagates not with the wave speed $c_0$ but with the _group velocity_ $\alpha$:
$$
\alpha=\frac{d\omega}{dk}(k_0).
$$
In general, the group velocity is different from the wave speed (it is equal to the wave speed only if there is no dispersion).
The shape of the envelope will still remain the same. However, if we kept a quadratic term in the Taylor expansion of $\omega(k)$,
it would lead to some changes in the shape of the wave packet, namely: the width of the Gaussian envelope  will increase with time, as you will discover in a homework problem.

## Dispersion
We have derived  that the harmonic wave $\eta=A\cos(kx-\omega t)$ is
a solution if $\omega=\pm\sqrt{g\,k}$. This relation between the
angular frequency $\omega$ and the angular wave number $k$ is
called the dispersion relation. It implies that the wave moves with the
wave speed (also known as phase velocity)
$$
c = \frac{\omega}{k}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}=\pm\sqrt{\frac{g\lambda}{2\pi}}.
$$
So we see that longer waves move faster than shorter waves.

A wave packet with wave numbers localised around $k$, as described in lecture [-@sec-6], moves with the
group velocity
$$
c_g=\frac{d\omega}{dk}=\pm\frac12\sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}=\frac12 c.
$$
So for water waves the group velocity is half the phase velocity.
