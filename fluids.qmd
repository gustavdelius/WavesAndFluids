# Fluids
Fluid dynamics studies the motion of fluids (gases and liquids, e.g. air or water).

TODO: Motivation. Uses. Mathematics required.

Fluid dynamics is a huge subject. In this introduction to the subject we will concentrate on ideal fluids,
which we will define later. In spite of this restriction we will be able to understand some important
phenomena, like the lift on an airplane wing or the surface waves on water.
