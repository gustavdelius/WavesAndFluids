# Velocity potential, stream function, and complex potential

In this section we will develop a powerful method that provides us an unlimited supply of two dimensional incompressible and irrotational flows
and hence solutions of the Euler equations. This will make clever use of complex analysis.

In the discussions in this lecture the time variable does not play a role, so we neglect to write it in all equations. But everything
is allowed to have a time dependence.

## Velocity potential
Consider an __irrotational__ flow, so that $\nabla\times\underline{u}=\underline{z}$. Then you know from Vector Calculus that there is a scalar function $\phi$
so that 
$$
\underline{u} = \nabla\phi.
$$
This $\phi$ is called the __velocity potential__. It can be obtained from a line integral:
$$
\phi(\underline{x})=\int^{\underline{x}}\underline{u}(\tilde\underline{x})\cdot d\tilde\underline{x}.
$$
Here we have not specified the starting point of the line integral because a change in the starting point only 
leads to a change in $\phi$ by a constant that does not contribute to the gradient of $\phi$. It can thus can be chosen
arbitrarily. 

If the domain in which the velocity field $\underline{u}$ is defined is not
simply connected, then $\phi$ may be multi-valued. We will see an example of
that later in @sec:circulation, but first we will look at a simple example to
make sure we understand the line integral.

::: {#exm-ex14}
Show that the velocity field, given by
$$
\underline{u}=(ax+by,bx+cy, -(a+c)z)
$$
(where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are constants), represents an irrotational flow and find the velocity potential.
:::

::: {.solution}
First we check whether the flow is irrotational by calculating the vorticity
$$
\nabla\times\underline{u}=(\partial_yu_z-\partial_zu_y,\partial_zu_x-\partial_xu_z,\partial_xu_y-\partial_yu_x)=(0,0,b-b)=\underline{z}.
$$

Then to calculate
$$
\phi(\underline{x})=\int_{\underline{z}}^{\underline{x}} \underline{u}(\tilde\underline{x})\cdot d\tilde\underline{x}.
$$
we choose the contour that consists of three straight lines: it starts from $(0,0,0)$ and goes along the $x$ axis to $(x,0,0)$, then goes
straight to $(x,y,0)$ and then from there straight to $(x,y,z)$. This splits the integral into three bits:
$$\begin{split}
\phi(\underline{x})&=\int_0^x u_x(\tilde{x},0,0)\,d\tilde x+\int_0^y u_y(x,\tilde{y},0)\,d\tilde y+\int_0^z u_y(x,y,\tilde{z})\,d\tilde z\\
&=\int_0^x a\tilde{x}\,d\tilde x+\int_0^y (bx+c\tilde{y})\,d\tilde y-\int_0^z (a+c)\tilde z\,d\tilde z\\
&=\frac{a}{2}x^2+bxy+\frac{c}{2}y^2-\frac{a+c}{2}z^2.
\end{split}$$

Alternatively, and equivalently, we can find $\phi$ by solving the 
component differential equations contained in $\underline{u}=\nabla \phi$:
$$
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
ax+by = \partial_x\phi,  \\
bx+cy = \partial_y\phi,  \\
-(a+c)z = \partial_z\phi,
\end{array}\right. \quad \Rightarrow \quad
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
\phi= \frac{a}{2}x^2 + bxy+ f(y,z),  \\
\phi=  bxy+\frac{c}{2}y^2 + g(x,z),  \\
\phi= - \frac{a+c}{2} z^2+ h(x,y)
\end{array}\right.
$$
The last three equations must represent the same function. Therefore,
$$
\phi=\frac{a}{2}x^2+bxy+\frac{c}{2}y^2-\frac{a+c}{2}z^2 + \text{ constant}.
$$

## Stream function
Consider an __incompressible, two-dimensional __ flow, so $\nabla\cdot\underline{u}=\underline{z}$ and $\underline{u}(\underline{x})=(u_x(x,y),u_y(x,y),0)$.
Then we can write this in terms of a scalar function $\psi(x,y)$ as follows:
$$
\underline{u}=\nabla\times(\psi\,\underline{e}_z)=(\partial_y\psi,-\partial_x\psi,0).
$$
It is easy to check that this always gives an incompressible flow:
$$
\nabla\cdot\underline{u}=\partial_xu_x+\partial_yu_y=\partial_x\partial_y\psi-\partial_y\partial_x\psi=0.
$$
The function $\psi$ is known as the __stream function__. The reason for this name is that a stream function
is constant along streamlines. To check this we calculate the derivative of $\psi$ in the direction of a streamline,
i.e., in the direction of the velocity field (recall that the velocity field is tangent to the streamlines).
$$
\underline{u}\cdot\nabla\psi=u_x\partial_x\psi+u_y\partial_y\psi=u_x(-u_y)+u_yu_x=0.
$$
Thus the stream function gives an easy way to obtain streamlines: they are the lines along which the streamline is constant.

We can find $\psi$ from the following two-dimensional line integral:
$$
\psi(x,y)=\int^{(x,y)}(-u_y,u_x)\cdot d\underline{x}.
$$ {#eq-lipsi}
Again it does not matter where we start the line integral because that only changes the integral by a constant that does
not affect the velocity field.

::: {#exm-ex:stagnation}
Consider the velocity field $\underline{u}=(ax,-ay,0)$ that you have met before in your homework and that we know is irrotational. We can
obtain its stream function from the line integral in \eqref{lipsi}:
$$
\psi(x,y)=\int_0^x(-u_y(\tilde{x},0))d\tilde{x}+\int_0^yu_x(x,\tilde{y})d\tilde{y}=
\int_0^x0\,d\tilde{x}+\int_0^yax\,d\tilde{y}=axy.
$$
The streamlines are the lines along which $\psi(x,y)=c$ for some constant $c$. Here this gives $axy=c$ and hence
$$
y=\frac{c}{a}\frac{1}{x}.
$$
So the stream lines are hyperbolas, as you already determined in a different way in the homework.

## Complex potential

Now we consider flows $\underline{u}$ that are irrotational and incompressible and two-dimensional, so they can be described by both
a velocity potential as $\underline{u}=\nabla\phi$ and by a stream function as $\underline{u}=\nabla\times(\psi\underline{e}_x)$. In components this gives
$$\begin{split}
u_x&=\partial_x\phi=\partial_y\psi,\\
u_y&=\partial_y\phi=-\partial_x\psi.
\end{split}$$
You will recognise these as the Cauchy-Riemann equations. They tell us that the function
$$
w=\phi+i\psi
$$
is a holomorphic function of $z=x+iy$. This function is known as the __complex potential__.

Note that here we are identifying the $x-y$ plane with the complex plane and use $z$ to denote the complex
number in that plane. This has nothing to do with the $z$ coordinate that we used when discussing 3-dimensional flows.
While in general it is a bad idea to use the same letter in the same module for different things, it is just so conventional to
use the letter $z$ both for the third Cartesian coordinate as well as for complex numbers that it is excusable in this case.

To extract the velocity field from the complex potential, we just need to differentiate:
$$
\frac{dw}{dz} = \partial_x w= \partial_x (\phi+i\psi)=\partial_x\phi+i\partial_x\psi=u_x-iu_y.
$$

Any holomorphic function gives us a solution of Euler's equations, because any holomorphic
function can be used as a complex potential describing an incompressible irrotational flow. Such
a flow solves Euler's equations. To see this
we start with Euler's equation in the form given in \eqref{vortex2}:
$$
\partial_t \underline{u}+(\nabla\times\underline{u})\times\underline{u}=-\nabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{u^2}2+\chi\right),
$$
where $\chi$ is the gravitational potential.
For our irrotational flow the vorticity $\nabla\times\underline{u}$ vanishes. Substituting $\underline{u}=\nabla\phi$ on the left-hand side and moving the
time derivative through the gradient we obtain
$$
\nabla(\partial_t \phi)=-\nabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{u^2}2+\chi\right),
$$
This equation is satisfied if the pressure is given by
$$
p=-\rho\left(\partial_t\phi +\frac{u^2}2+\chi \right) + \text{ constant}.
$$

It is now easy to come up with examples of fluid flows, because we can simply choose any homomorphic function for
our complex potential.

\begin{example}{\rm
Consider the complex potential
$$
w(z)=\frac{a}{2}z^2=\frac{a}{2}(x+iy)^2=\frac{a}{2}(x^2-y^2)+i axy=\phi+i\psi.
$$
We recognise the stream function $\psi=axy$ to be the one for the stagnation flow in Example \ref{ex:stagnation}.
We obtain the velocity field from the derivative of the complex potential:
$$
\frac{dw}{dz} = az=ax+iay,
$$
so $u_x=ax$ and $u_y=-ay$, which again agrees with  Example \ref{ex:stagnation}.
}\end{example}

::: {#exm-straight}
Consider the complex potential
$$
w(z)=ae^{i\alpha}z,
$$
so that the derivative is just
$$
\frac{dw}{dz} = ae^{i\alpha}=a(\cos\alpha+i\sin\alpha)
$$
from which we can read off that
$u_x=a\cos\alpha$ and $u_y=-a\sin\alpha$. This is a constant flow at an angle $-\alpha$ to the horizontal.
