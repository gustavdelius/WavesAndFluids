## Harmonic waves

Harmonic waves are waves that are described by sines and cosines. A travelling
harmonic wave can be written as
$$
y(x,t)=a \cos\left(kx - \omega t + \phi\right)
$$ {#eq-harmonic1}
or
$$
y(x,t)=a \cos\left(2\pi(\hat{k}x - \nu t) + \phi\right)
$$ {#eq-harmonic2}
where $a$ is the amplitude, $\hat{k}$ the wave number, $\nu$ the frequency,
$\phi$ the phase, and where
$$
k= 2\pi\hat{k} \quad \text{and} \quad \omega = 2\pi \nu
$$ {#eq-5.3}
are the angular wave number and the angular frequency, respectively. Note that
$k$ and $\omega$ are used more often that $\hat{k}$ and $\nu$ and that the
prefix `angular' is often discarded.

### Terminology

- _Frequency_ $=$ number of cycles (oscillations) per unit time.
- _Wave number_ $=$ number of cycles (oscillations) per unit length.
- _Period_ $=$ time $P$ needed to complete one cycle (oscillation):
  $$
  P=\frac{1}{\nu}=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}.
  $$ {#eq-5.4}
- _Wave length_ $=$ distance between two consecutive wave crests (peaks):
  $$
  \lambda = \frac{1}{\hat{k}}=\frac{2\pi}{k}.
  $$ {#eq-5.5}
- _Wave speed_ $=$ speed at which the wave is travelling:
  $$
  c = \frac{\lambda}{P}=\frac{\nu}{\hat{k}}=\frac{\omega}{k}.
  $$ {#eq-5.6}
  (Sometimes, the wave speed is also called the _phase speed_.)

The harmonic wave @eq-harmonic1 can be written as
$$\begin{split}
y(x,t)&=a \cos\left(kx - \omega t + \phi\right) \\
&= \operatorname{Re}\left( a e^{i\phi} e^{i(kx-\omega t)}\right)\\
&=\operatorname{Re}\left( A e^{i(kx-\omega t)}\right),
\end{split}$$ {#eq-harmonic3}
where we have included the phase factor $e^{i\phi}$ into the complex amplitude:
$A= a e^{i\phi}$.

Consider now the complex quantity $A e^{i(kx-\omega t)}$. Direct substitution
shows that it is a solution of the wave equation and so are both its real and
imaginary parts. So, we shall consider complex solutions of the form
$$
y(x,t)= A \, e^{i(kx-\omega t)}
$$ {#eq-harmonic4}
for any $A\in\mathbb{C}$, any $k\in\mathbb{R}$ and some $\omega(k)$. To find
$\omega(k)$, we substitute @eq-harmonic4 into the wave equation:
$$
\partial_t^2 y =c^2 \partial_x^2 y  \quad 
\Rightarrow \quad -\omega^2 A =-c^2 k^2 A.
$$ {#eq-5.9}
Therefore
$$
\omega(k) = \pm ck
$$ {#eq-5.10}
The function $\omega(k)$ is called the _dispersion relation_. The above formula
shows that, for the wave equation, $\omega$ is proportional to $k$.

## Solving PDEs with harmonic waves

::: {.callout-important}
Any linear homogeneous PDE (in variables $x$ and $t$) with constant coefficients
has harmonic wave solutions @eq-harmonic4 for some $\omega(k)$.

Consider the damped string (with friction force proportional to velocity):
 $$
  \partial_t^2 \, y= c^2 \, \partial_x^2 \, y - p\, \partial_t \, y\quad \text{where }\
  p>0.
$$ {#eq-damped1}
Substituting the harmonic wave @eq-harmonic4 into this equation, we obtain
$$
-\omega^2 y =- c^2 k^2 y +ip\,\omega y .
$$ {#eq-5.12}
Cancelling the $y$ we obtain a quadratic equation for $\omega^2$ which has the
complex solution
$$
\omega = -\frac{ip}{2}\pm \sqrt{c^2 k^2 - \frac{p^2}{4}}.
$$ {#eq-iw}
Thus we have the following solution for the damped string:
$$\begin{split}
y(x,t)&= A \, e^{i\left(kx+\frac{ip}{2}t\pm \sqrt{c^2 k^2 - \frac{p^2}{4}} t\right)} \\
&=A \, e^{-\frac{pt}{2}}e^{ik\left(x\pm \sqrt{c^2  - \frac{p^2}{4k^2}} t\right)}
\end{split}$$ {#eq-dampedy}
So we see that we have a wave with exponentially decreasing amplitude which is a
consequence of the damping. The wave speed is now dependent on the wave number
$k$:
$$
c(k)=\sqrt{c^2  - p^2/(4k^2)}.
$$ {#eq-5.15}
If we want to, we can get a real solution by taking the real part of the complex
solution:
$$
\operatorname{Re}(y(x,t))=a\, e^{-pt/2} \cos\left[k\left(x \pm t \, \sqrt{c^2  - p^2/(4k^2)}\right)+\phi\right]
$$ {#eq-5.16}
where $a=\vert A\vert$ and $\phi=\arg(A)$. 

:::

Note that the imaginary part of $\omega$ in @eq-iw produces the damping
exponential and the real part of $\omega$ determines the wave speed.
