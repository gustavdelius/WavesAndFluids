# Flow around a cylinder, circulation, and the Magnus effect
In this lecture we will explain a fascinating phenomenon: a rotating cylinder flying through air experiences a perpendicular force. 
This phenomenon is most familiar when the rotating cylinder is replaced by a rotating ball: curve balls.

## Flow around a cylinder {#sec-cylinder}
We are on the way to describing the flow around an airfoil. We want the flow to have the following three properties:

1. The flow is two-dimensional, incompressible and irrotational.

2. Far away from the airfoil, the flow should be uniform and straight.

3. On the surface of the airfoil, the flow follows the surface.

We will now argue that the flow described by the complex potential
$$
w(z)=a\left(z+\frac{R^2}{z}\right)
$$
has these properties, albeit for a cylindrical airfoil of radius $R$ centred on the origin, as depicted in
the first picture in Figure \ref{fig:magnus}. We'll see in the next
lecture how we can deform the cylinder to a more airfoil-like shape. Let us verify the three properties.

1. Any  flow described by a complex potential is two-dimensional, incompressible and irrotational.

2. Far away from the origin, $|z|\ll 1$ and the term in $w$ that
is proportional to $1/z$ becomes irrelevant and $w(z)\approx az$. We have already seen in Example \ref{straight}
that this corresponds to a uniform horizontal flow.

3. The flow is a steady flow, so it follows the streamlines. The streamlines are lines where the stream function is constant

So we need to show  that the stream function is constant on
the circle of radius $R$. The stream function is the imaginary part of the complex potential, so we evaluate the complex potential at all points of the form $z=Re^{i\theta}$:
$$
w\left( Re^{i\theta}\right)=a\left(Re^{i\theta}+\frac{R^2}{Re^{i\theta}}\right)
=aR\left(e^{i\theta} +e^{-i\theta}\right)=aR\cos\theta.
$$
Thus on the circle of radius $R$ the complex potential has no imaginary part, i.e., the streamfunction is zero there, hence
constant. 


## Circulation {#sec-circulation}

We now look at a flow around a rotating cylinder, in which the air close to the cylinder is rotating along with 
it, as depicted in the second flow in Figure \ref{fig:magnus}. ^[Of course in a perfectly inviscid fluid the cylinder would not be able to drag the fluid along with it due to the absence
of shear forces, so we can not describe how this circulating flow is created, but once it is established we can 
describe it.]
We start with the complex potential
$$
w(z)=i a \log z.
$$
This is holomorphic outside the cylinder.

We find the velocity field from the derivative
$$
\frac{dw}{dz} = \frac{ia}{z}=\frac{ia}{x+iy}=\frac{ia(x-iy)}{x^2+y^2}=\frac{ay}{x^2+y^2}-i\frac{-ax}{x^2+y^2}.
$$
Introducing $r^2=x^2+y^2$ we read off the velocity components
$$
u_x=\frac{a}{r^2}y ~~\text{ and }~~ u_y=-\frac{a}{r^2}x.
$$
This is similar to the circular flow from Example \ref{ex1} just with an extra factor of $-a/r^2$, so this flow too
is a circular flow, but with its angular velocity $\Omega$ decreasing with increasing distance from the centre,
$\Omega=-a/r$.
It is easy to look at this in polar coordinates: we simply need to write $z=re^{i\theta}$.
We then have
$$
w(z)=i a \log z=ia\log\left( re^{i\theta}\right)=ia\left( \log r+i\theta\right)=-a\theta+ia\log r.
$$
So the velocity potential is $\phi=-a\theta$ and the stream function is $\psi = a\log r$.
The streamlines are lines of constant $\psi$, so lines of constant $r$, hence circles centred on the origin.

Remember that any flow described by a complex potential is irrotational. Yes, the fluid rotates around the origin,
but an extended particle placed in the fluid does not rotate around its own axis. Now, if you do not believe this, in
spite of the maths, you can also do the experiment. You can create something close to this flow by filling your bathroom sink
and then pulling out the stopper. You will observe that the angular velocity of the water decreases with the distance
from the plughole. If you glue together two matches to form a cross and place them on the water, you will see the 
cross circling the plughole, but without rotating around its own axis. Instead its orientation will stay constant.
The vorticity of the flow is zero. To make the situation even more perverse, this flow is called
the {\bf line vortex flow}, in spite of its zero vorticity.

While the line vortex flow is irrotational, it has non-zero {\bf circulation}. 
The circulation $\Gamma$ of a velocity field along a closed curve $C$ is defined as the line integral of the velocity field along that closed curve,
$$
\Gamma = \oint_C \underline{u}\cdot d\underline{x}.
$$ {#eq-circulation}
According to Stoke's theorem
$$
\oint_C \underline{u}\cdot d\underline{x}=\int_S(\nabla\times\underline{u})\cdot d\boldsymbol{S} ,
$$ {#eq-stokes}
where $S$ is a surface enclosed by $C$.
If the flow is irrotational, so that $\nabla\times\underline{u}=\underline{z}$, this seems to indicate that the circulation will always be zero.
However this argument only works if the vector field is defined everywhere on the surface $S$. This will not be the case if the curve $C$ encircles
a line along which the vector field is not defined. This is the case for the line vortex flow, which is undefined along the entire $z$ axis.

For a two-dimensional flow with a complex potential $w$, the line integral for the circulation $\Gamma$ in \eqref{circulation} can be written as a contour
integral in the complex plane. To derive this we start with the fact that $dw/dz=u_x-iu_y$. Hence
$$
\oint_C\frac{dw}{dz}dz=\oint_C(u_x-iu_y)(dx+idy)=\oint_C(u_x\,dx+u_y\,dy)-i\oint_C(u_y\,dx-u_x\,dy)
$$
Thus
$$
\Gamma = \oint_C \underline{u}\cdot d\underline{x}=\oint_C(u_x\,dx+u_y\,dy)=\operatorname{Re}\left(\oint_C\frac{dw}{dz}dz\right).
$$
In the example of the vortex flow with the complex potential $w=ia\log z$ this gives
$$
\Gamma = \operatorname{Re}\left(\oint_C\frac{ia}{z}dz\right)=-2\pi\,a.
$$
The contour integral was easy to perform thanks to Cauchy's residue theorem. It is nice to see how vector calculus and
complex analysis merge to be helpful in fluid dynamics.



## Magnus effect {#sec-magnus}
We now explain the Magnus effect, whereby a spinning cylinder in an air flow can experience a force perpendicular to the airflow. This is 
similar to the phenomenon of curve balls, except that the flow around the cylinder can be described by a two-dimensional flow unlike
the flow around a spinning ball.

![The flow around a rotating cylinder moving through still air is obtained as the sum of the flows from the previous sections,
which individually did not create a lift force.](magnus.png){#eq-fig:magnus}


The idea is that near the rotating cylinder the air is dragged along, leading to a flow as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:magnus}, with a faster flow above the cylinder
than below the cylinder. This flow can be obtained by adding a line vertex flow (see section \ref{sec:circulation}) to the flow around the non-rotating cylinder (see
section \ref{sec:cylinder}). If we add two complex potentials, we again obtain a valid complex potential (because the sum of two holomorphic functions is again
holomorphic). So we use the complex potential
$$
w(z)=a\left(z+\frac{R^2}{z}\right)+ib\log z.
$$ {#eq-wl}
The stagnation points --
the points at which the flow velocity is zero -- are where the velocity of the line-vortex flow exactly cancels the velocity of the flow around the
non-rotating cylinder. They are moved downwards by the clockwise rotation of the cylinder.

Bernoulli's theorem for irrotational flow gives us the pressure as
$$
p = -\frac{\rho}{2}u^2 + \text{ constant}.
$$
We do not care about the value of the constant because the force is caused only by  pressure differences. In order to 
calculate the force acting on the cylinder we need to calculate
the pressure everywhere on the surface of the cylinder, so we need the velocities there. We calculate these by taking the derivative of
the complex potential and evaluating it at  $z=Re^{i\theta}$,
$$
\frac{dw}{dz}=a\left(1-\frac{R^2}{z^2}\right)+\frac{ib}{z}=a\left(1-e^{-2i\theta}\right)+\frac{ib}{R}e^{-i\theta}
=e^{-i\theta}\left( 2ia\sin(\theta)+\frac{ib}{R}\right).
$$
From this we get the square of the velocity as
$$
u^2=u_x^2+u_y^2=(u_x-iu_y)(u_x-iu_y)=\left|\frac{dw}{dz}\right|^2=\left(2a\sin\theta-\frac{b}{R}\right)^2
$$
and thus the pressure as
$$
p=-2\rho\left(a^2\sin^2\theta-a\frac{b}{R}\sin\theta\right) +\text{ constant}.
$$
This now allows us to calculate the force $dF$ on an infinitesimal angular segment of the cylinder between $\theta$ and $\theta+d\theta$.
The force is constant along the length of the cylinder, so we calculate just the force per unit length. According to the definition of
the pressure this force is
$$
d\underline{F} = -p\underline{n}\, dl = -p\underline{n}  R\,d\theta.
$$
where $\underline{n}$ is the outwards normal. We are interested in the $y$ component of this:
$$
dF_y = -p\,R\sin\theta  \,d\theta.
$$
Integrating this over the entire circle of radius $R$ gives
$$\begin{split}
F_y&=-\int_0^{2\pi}p(\theta)\,R\sin\theta\,d\theta\\
&=\int_0^{2\pi}\rho\left(2a^2\sin^3\theta-2a\frac{b}{R}\sin^2\theta\right)R\,d\theta\\
&=2\pi\rho\, a\, b.
\end{split}$$ {#eq-magnus}
So we have derived that the cylinder experiences a non-zero lift force that is proportional to the air density,
the velocity of the air flow, and the angular velocity of the cylinder.

## A comment on units and dimensions {#sec-units}
When describing the real world, quantities have units and dimensions. For example, the radius of a cylinder has dimension of
length and can be measured in either meters or feet or centimetres or ... There are three ways to deal with this:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Agree on a system of units and measure everything in terms of these units. The most common system is the SI system,
where length is measured in meters (m), time - in seconds (s), mass - in kilograms (kg). So we would write
$$
\text{radius }=R \text{ meters}
$$
and then work with $R$ in our formulas. This seems natural to a mathematician because it means that the
mathematician never has to think about units and dimensions because there is an agreed way to express
all quantities as just numbers. But one looses some benefits.

\item Choose units that are natural for the problem at hand. For example if the radius of the cylinder is the
most important length in the problem, then it is natural to measure all other lengths as multiples of this radius.
This has the nice effect that
$$
\text{radius }=1.
$$
None of the formulas will ever have to involve a parameter $R$. By similarly choosing a natural time and a natural
mass, we can get rid of 3 parameters. This is why applied mathematicians sometimes like this approach because
it leads to simpler expressions. It goes by the name of ``non-dimensionalisation''. Theoretical physicists use it to
set $c=\hbar=G=1$.

\item Don't specify units and keep all quantities as dimensionful quantities. So
$$
\text{radius }=R.
$$
This has the disadvantage over the previous approach that it does not reduce the number of parameters. But
it has the advantage that we have an easy way to check whether the equations we derive make sense. If in
any equation the different terms do not all have the same dimension, then we know we have made a mistake.
For people like me who make mistakes very easily, this is very valuable.
\end{enumerate}

It is clear that the first approach above has no advantages, because it neither decreases the number of parameters
in the equations nor does it give us a way to use the dimensions of the terms in the equation as a check. Nevertheless
unfortunately it is often adopted without thinking, and I did so in this lecture. Take a look for example at \eqref{wl}:
$$
w(z)=a\left(z+\frac{R^2}{z}\right)+ib\log z.
$$
The fact that it contains $\log z$ shows that $z$ is dimensionless (because you can't take the log of a dimensionful
number). The fact that it still contains $R$ means that I did not take approach 2, i.e., $z$ is not measured in multiples
of $R$. 

I will switch to using option 3 for the rest of the module to always have a check on the results.
