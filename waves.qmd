# Waves

Waves are so fundamentally important because waves are the only way
information can propagate in this universe. 
Some waves that propagate information are obvious:
sound waves, light and radio waves, electric waves travelling along our neurons.
Others are less obvious: even if I communicate with you by shooting a particle
at you, this is described by a wave, as you will learn in quantum mechanics.
Gravitational effects are communicated via gravitational waves.

Because waves propagate at a finite speed, also information can only propagate
at that wave speed. This has profound impacts, as you know from the theory of
special relativity. For example, we can look far back into the past because some of
the light waves emitted shortly after the big bang 16 billion years ago are only
now arriving here, strongly red-shifted and thus detectable as microwaves.

Studying waves is also of great practical importance. They play an important
part in our technological world. Improvements in our understanding of how to
generate and control electromagnetic waves, for example, has led to radio, radar
and mobile phones. Understanding how a pest propagates in the form of an
invasion wave into so-far uninfected territory allows us to prepare adequate
interventions. Understanding how density waves form in traffic flow, leading to
traffic jams, allows us to design interventions that lead to smoother traffic
flow.
