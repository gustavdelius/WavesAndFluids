## Fluid flow

Fluids are considered as continuous media. Because any small volume element of a
fluid contains a huge number of molecules, instead of
describing the location and velocity of all the individual molecules, we work
with quantities which should be thought of as averages over very small
neighbourhoods.

So we describe the distribution of matter via a smooth density function
$\rho(x,y,z,t)$ (mass/volume) and its motion via a smooth velocity field
$\underline{u}(x,y,z,t)$.

The fluid velocity is a vector field, which means that it is a vector whose
direction and magnitude may be different at different points in space:
$$\begin{split}
\underline{u}(x,y,z,t) &=(u_x(x,y,z,t),u_y(x,y,z,t),u_z(x,y,z,t))\\
&= u_x(x,y,z,t) \underline{e}_x + u_y(x,y,z,t) \underline{e}_y + 
u_z(x,y,z,t) \underline{e}_z .
\end{split}$$ {#eq-10.1}
We will also use the shorthand $\underline{u}(\underline{x},t)$ where
$\underline{x}=(x,y,z)$ is the position vector.

We will sometimes be looking at particular simple kinds of flows:

::: {#def-steady}
A __steady flow__ is a flow whose velocity field at every point is independent of time:
$$
\partial_t\underline{u} =0,~~ \text{ i.e., }~~ \underline{u}(\underline{x},t)=\underline{u}(\underline{x}).
$$
:::


::: {#def-twodim}
A __two-dimensional (2D) flow__ is a flow whose velocity field is independent of the third coordinate (which we will always choose to be the $z$ coordinate) and has no component in that third direction: 
$$
\partial_z\underline{u} =0 \text{ and }u_z=0,
$$
i.e.,
$$
\underline{u}(\underline{x},t)=u_x(x,y,t)\underline{e}_x + u_y(x,y,t)\underline{e}_y=(u_x(x,y,t),u_y(x,y,t),0).
$$
:::

A vector field can be visualised by drawing vectors attached to different points
in space. In the video lecture we work through the sketch of the velocity field
for the 2D flow $\underline{u}=(-y,x,0)$.



## Pathlines and streamlines

<iframe src="https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=62d6326c-44c4-4609-8f0a-af79012559a2&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=true&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>


### Pathlines

We want to answer the question: given the velocity field $\underline{u}(\underline{x},t)$, how does a fluid particle (i.e. a very small volume element of the fluid or a small particle embedded in the fluid) move?

Let $\underline{x}(t)$ be the position of a fluid particle in the flow with the velocity
$\underline{u}(\underline{x},t)$ at time $t$. Then it must satisfy the following vector ODE:

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
### Pathline equation
$$
\frac{d\underline{x}(t)}{dt}=\underline{u}(\underline{x}(t),t).
$$ {#eq-fluid_particle}
:::

Equivalently, we can write this vector ODE as a system of three scalar ODEs:
$$\begin{split}
\frac{dx(t)}{dt}&=u_x(x(t),y(t),z(t),t),\\
\frac{dy(t)}{dt}&=u_y(x(t),y(t),z(t),t),\\
\frac{dz(t)}{dt}&=u_z(x(t),y(t),z(t),t).
\end{split}$$ {#eq-fluid_particle2}


::: {#exm-10_1}
Find the pathlines for the 2D flow $\underline{u}=(-y,x,0)$.
:::

::: {.solution}

We solve the ODEs
$$
\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=-y(t), \quad \frac{dy(t)}{dt}=x(t), \quad \frac{dz(t)}{dt}=0.
$$ {#eq-10.4}
The general solution of this system is
$$\
x(t)=A\sin t + B\cos  t, ~~~
y(t)=- A\cos  t +B\sin t,~~~z(t)=C
$$ {#eq-10.5}
for some constants $A,B,C$.
If we have initial conditions $x(0)=x_0$, $y(0)=y_0$ and $z(0)=z_0$, we find
that $B=x_0$, $A=y_0$ and $C=z_0$. Thus, we have
$$\begin{split}
x(t)&=-y_0 \sin t + x_0\cos t,\\
y(t)&=y_0\cos t + x_0 \sin t,\\
z(t)&= z_0.
\end{split}$$ {#eq-fluid_particle5}
It is clear now that the pathline starting at $(x_0,y_0)$ is a circle of radius
$\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}$.
:::

Next we look at an example of a non-steady flow.

::: {#exm-10_2}
We consider the 2D flow $\underline{u}=(x,t,0)$. In the video lecture we sketch
this velocity field at $t=0$ and $t=1$.

To find the pathlines we solve the ODEs
$$
\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=x(t), \quad \frac{dy(t)}{dt}=t, \quad \frac{dz(t)}{dt}=0.
$$ {#eq-10.7}
The solution of this system with initial values $\underline{x}(0)=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is
$$
x(t)=x_0e^t, ~~~
y(t)=\frac12 t^2 y_0,~~~z(t)=z_0.
$$ {#eq-10.8}

:::


### Streamlines

A _streamline_ of a flow is a curve such that, at each point of the curve, the
tangent line to it is parallel to the velocity at the same point. If the
velocity field depends on time, then streamlines may be different at different
moments of time. Let $\underline{u}(\underline{x},t)$ be a velocity field. It follows from this
definition that if $\underline{x}(s)=(x(s),y(s),z(s))$ is a parametrisation of a
streamline (with some parameter $s$ along the streamline), then the tangent
vector to the curve, $d\underline{x}(s)/ds$, must be parallel to $\underline{u}(\underline{x}(s),t)$. This
means
$$
\frac{d\underline{x}(s)}{ds}=\lambda \, \underline{u}(\underline{x}(s),t)
$$ {#eq-10.9}
where $\lambda$ is a nonzero scalar which may depend on both $\underline{x}$ and $t$.
Clearly, there is a freedom in choosing $\lambda$. The simplest choice that we
shall use from now on is $\lambda=1$. So, the streamlines are solutions of the
following vector ODE:

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
### Streamline equation
$$
\frac{d\underline{x}(s)}{ds}=\underline{u}(\underline{x}(s),t)
$$ {#eq-streamline1}
:::

In components this equation becomes
$$\begin{split}
\frac{dx(s)}{ds}&=u_x(x(s),y(s),z(s),t),\\
\frac{dy(s)}{ds}&=u_y(x(s),y(s),z(s),t),\\
\frac{dz(s)}{ds}&=u_z(x(s),y(s),z(s),t).
\end{split}$$ {#eq-streamline2}

So in @exm-10_2 the ODEs for the streamlines are
$$
\frac{dx(s)}{ds}=x(s), \quad \frac{dy(s)}{ds}=t, \quad \frac{dz(s)}{ds}=0.
$$ {#eq-10.12}
The solution of this system for the streamline starting at
$\underline{x}(0)=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is
$$
x(s)=x_0e^s, ~~~
y(t)=\frac12 st+ y_0,~~~z(t)=z_0.
$$ {#eq-10.13}
Note that this is different from the pathlines that we determined for @exm-10_2

For steady flows ($\underline{u}=\underline{u}(\underline{x})$) streamlines
coincide with pathlines, because @eq-streamline2 will be exactly the same as
@eq-fluid_particle2, with $s=t$. But in general pathlines and streamlines represent different quantities and should not be confused with each other. To summarise:

__Pathlines__ are the paths traced out by individual fluid particles as they move through a flow field over a period of time. In other words, a pathline is the trajectory followed by a single fluid particle in the flow field, and it can be used to visualize the history of the particle's motion. Pathlines can be curved, twisted, or convoluted, and they can cross and intersect with each other.

__Streamlines__, on the other hand, are imaginary lines that are everywhere tangent to the velocity vector of the flow at a given instant in time. In other words, they represent the instantaneous direction of fluid motion at every point in the flow field. Streamlines do not represent the paths of individual fluid particles, but rather they represent the direction of the flow at any given instant. Streamlines are useful to visualize the flow pattern of a fluid.



## Material derivative

<iframe src="https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=2cbf2875-0e01-45b8-9114-af790125596b&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=true&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Let $f(\underline{x},t)$ be some quantity of interest (e.g. a component of the
velocity $\underline{u}$ or the density of the fluid $\rho$). The rate of change
of $f$ at a fixed point in space (i.e. at fixed $\underline{x}$) is $\partial_t
f(\underline{x},t)$. What is the rate of change of $f$ following the fluid (i.e.
the rate of change of $f$ at a given fluid particle as it moves with the fluid)?
We denote this as $Df/Dt$ and will refer to it as the _material derivative_ of
$f$. We have
$$\begin{split}
\frac{Df}{Dt} &= \frac{d}{dt} \, f(x(t),y(t),z(t),t)\\
&=\partial_t f(x,y,z,t)+\partial_x f(x,y,z,t)\, \frac{dx}{dt}\\
&\qquad\qquad +\partial_y f(x,y,z,t)\, \frac{dy}{dt} +\partial_z f(x,y,z,t)\, \frac{dz}{dt}\\
&=\partial_t f(x,y,z,t)+\partial_x f(x,y,z,t)\, u_x\\
&\qquad\qquad  +\partial_y f(x,y,z,t)\, u_y +\partial_z f(x(t),y,z,t)\, u_z \\
&=\partial_t f(\underline{x},t)+\underline{u}\cdot\underline{\nabla} f(\underline{x},t). 
\end{split}$$ {#eq-10.14}
Thus, we have

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
::: {#def-material}
The __material derivative__ of a function $f(x,y,z,t)$ is
$$
\frac{Df}{Dt} = \partial_t f +\underline{u}\cdot\underline{\nabla} f.
$$ {#eq-10.15}
:::
:::

In particular, $Df/Dt=0$ means that quantity $f$ is a constant for each fluid
particle.

::: {#exm-temp}
Assume the temperature of the fluid is given by $T(x,z,y,t) =-y$ and the
velocity field is $\underline{u}=(-y,x,0)$. So there is no time dependence in
either the temperature nor in the velocity field. Nevertheless a fluid particle
is going to experience a time-dependent temperature because
$$\begin{split}
\frac{DT}{Dt}&=\partial_tT+u_x\partial_xT+u_y\partial_yT+u_z\partial_zT\\
&=u_y\partial_yT=-x=y_0\sin t-x_0\cos t.
\end{split}$$ {#eq-10.16}
We used the expression for $x(t)$ from @eq-fluid_particle5.
:::

### Acceleration of a fluid particle

The velocity of a fluid particle (whose position at time $t$ is $\underline{x}(t)$) is
$\underline{u}(\underline{x}(t),t)$. To find the acceleration $\underline{a}(\underline{x}(t),t)$ of this fluid particle
we need to differentiate the velocity with respect to time. Thus

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
::: {#def-acceleration}
The __acceleration__ experienced by a fluid particle is
$$
\underline{a}(\underline{x},t) = \frac{D \underline{u}}{Dt}
=\partial_t \underline{u} + (\underline{u}\cdot\underline{\nabla}) \underline{u} .
$$ {#eq-10.17}
:::
:::

If we calculate the acceleration in Example @exm-10_2 where
$\underline{u}=(x,t,0)$ we get the acceleration
$$\begin{split}
\underline{a}(\underline{x},t) &=\frac{D \underline{u}}{Dt}=\partial_t \underline{u} + x\,\partial_x \underline{u} +t\,\partial_y \underline{u} +0\,\partial_z \underline{u} \\
&=(0,1,0)+x(1,0,0)=(x,1,0) .
\end{split}$$ {#eq-10.18}

## Conservation of mass

<iframe src="https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=0f9bb3b8-19ec-4db1-b337-af790125594c&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=true&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Let $\rho(\underline{x},t)$ be the density of the fluid, i.e. the mass of the
fluid per unit volume. The density is strictly positive: $\rho(\underline{x},t)> 0$ for all $\underline{x}$ and $t$. We shall deduce an equation governing the
evolution of $\rho$ from the law of conservation of mass.

Consider an arbitrary fixed (in space) volume $V$. The mass of the fluid in this
volume is
$$
\int\limits_{V}\rho(\underline{x},t)\,dV.
$$ {#eq-conserv_mass1}
Here $dV$ is the volume element (i.e. $dV=dx \, dy\, dz$). Let $\partial V$ be
the boundary of $V$ and $\underline{n}$ be the outward unit normal on $\partial
V$ (see
@fig-continuity). The rate at which mass of the fluid is flowing through a
surface element $dS$ on $\partial V$ is $\rho \underline{u}\cdot\underline{n} \,
dS$ (i.e. the normal component of the _mass flux density_ $\rho \underline{u}$
multiplied by the area $dS$ of the surface element). If
$\underline{u}\cdot\underline{n}$ is positive, then the fluid flows out of
volume $V$ through the surface element $dS$. If
$\underline{u}\cdot\underline{n}$ is negative, then the fluid flows into $V$.
So, the net rate at which mass is flowing out of $V$ though the boundary of $V$
is
$$
\oint\limits_{\partial V}\rho \underline{u}\cdot\underline{n} \, dS .
$$ {#eq-10.20}
If this integral is positive, this means that more fluid flows out than in; if
it is negative, then more fluid flows in than out.

![Flow through a fixed volume.](continuity.png){width=60% #fig-continuity}

The rate of change of mass in volume $V$ is the derivative with respect to time
of the integral in @eq-conserv_mass1. In view of to the law of conservation of
mass, it must be equal to the change of mass (per unit time) due to the inflow
and outflow of the fluid. Therefore, we obtain
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \, \int\limits_{V}\rho \, dV = \int\limits_{V}\partial_t\rho \, 
dV= -\oint\limits_{\partial V}\rho \underline{u}\cdot\underline{n} \, dS .
$$ {#eq-conserv_mass2}
Here the minus before the surface integral appears because $\underline{n}$ is chosen to be
the outward normal (so that the change of mass is negative if the fluid flows
out of $V$).

Now, we need to recall the divergence theorem (also known as  the
Gauss-Ostrogradsky theorem) of Vector Calculus which we already used in @sec-energy-of-membrane when
we discussed energy conservation in the example of the two-dimensional wave equation.

::: {#thm-div}
### Divergence theorem

If $V$ is a region in
$\mathbb{R}^3$ with boundary $\partial V$ and $\underline{F}(\underline{x})$ is a vector field defined in
$V$, then
$$
\int\limits_{V} \underline{\nabla}\cdot \underline{F} \, dV = \oint\limits_{\partial V} \underline{F}\cdot \underline{n} \, dS.
$$ {#eq-divergence_thrm1}
:::

Applying the divergence theorem to the surface integral on the right hand side
of @eq-conserv_mass2, we obtain
$$
\int\limits_{V} \partial_t \rho \, dV = -\int\limits_{V} \underline{\nabla}\cdot (\rho \, \underline{u}) \, dV,
$$ {#eq-10.23}
which we can rewrite as
$$
\int\limits_{V} \left[\partial_t \rho + \underline{\nabla}\cdot (\rho \, \underline{u})\right]\, dV = 0.
$$ {#eq-10.24}
The equation must hold for any volume $V$. This is possible only if the
integrand is zero. Thus we have derived the conservation equation for the mass, which is also known
as the continuity equation.

::: {.callout-important}
### Mass conservation equation
$$
\partial_t \rho + \underline{\nabla}\cdot (\rho \, \underline{u}) =0 .
$$ {#eq-conserv_mass3}
:::


Note that since $\underline{\nabla}\cdot (\rho \, \underline{u})=
\underline{u}\cdot\underline{\nabla}\rho + \rho \, \underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline{u}$, the equation
of continuity can be written as
$$
\partial_t \rho + \underline{u}\cdot\underline{\nabla}\rho + \rho \, \underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline{u} =0
$$ {#eq-conserv_mass4a}
or
$$
\frac{D\rho}{Dt} + \rho\, \underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline{u} =0 .
$$ {#eq-conserv_mass4b}
If the fluid is incompressible then the density of each fluid element must remain constant as the fluid moves, i.e.
$$
\frac{D\rho}{Dt} =0.
$$ {#eq-conserv_mass5}
It then follows from @eq-conserv_mass4b that
$$
\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline{u} =0 .
$$ {#eq-conserv_mass6}

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
::: {#def-incompressible}
A fluid whose flow everywhere satisfies the _incompressibility condition_
$$
\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline{u} =0 .
$$ {#eq-conserv_mass6}
is called __incompressible__.
:::
:::

A vector field $\underline{u}$
satisfying $\underline{\nabla}\cdot\underline{u}$ is known as a _solenoidal vector field_ or
a _divergence-free vector field_.
