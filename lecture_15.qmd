# Why airplanes fly
Our calculation of the lift on the rotating cylinder in the previous section was
very specific to the particular example. In this section we will see that, by
using complex analysis techniques, we can get an expression for the lift force
that works more generally. The result turns out to be independent of the details
of the flow and only involves the flow velocity far from the aerofoil and the
circulation around the aerofoil.

### Blasius theorem 
The force $\underline{F}$ per unit length on an aerofoil in an incompressible,
irrotational flow described by a complex potential $w(z)$ is given by
$$
F_x - i F_y = i\frac{\rho}{2}\oint_C\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2 dz,
$$ {#eq-15.1}
where $C$ is any contour encircling the aerofoil.
:::

In this subsection we will derive this expression. For this purpose we first
consider the force $d\underline{F}$ on an infinitesimal segment of length $dl$
of the cross section of the aerofoil. In terms of the angle $\theta$ that is
indicated in @fig-segment we have
$$
dF_x = p\cos\theta\,dl,~~~dF_y = -p\sin\theta\,dl,
$$ {#eq-15.2}
and thus
$$
dF_x - i\, dF_y = p\,(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)\,dl = p\,e^{i\theta} dl.
$$ {#eq-15.2b}
Notice how by reinterpreting the $x$-$y$ plane as the complex plane we can
avoid having to deal with sines and cosines.

![Force $d\underline{F}$ acting on an infinitesimal segment $dl$.](aerofoil_segment.png){width=80% #fig-segment}

The flow is tangential to the aerofoil, so the velocity components are
$$
u_x=|u|\sin\theta,~~~u_y=|u|\cos\theta.
$$ {#eq-15.3}
We can relate that to the derivative of the complex potential,
$$
\frac{dw}{dz} = u_x-i u_y
=|u|\left(\sin\theta-i\cos\theta\right)=-i|u|e^{i\theta},
$$ {#eq-15.4}
and thus
$$
|u|=ie^{-i\theta}\frac{dw}{dz}.
$$ {#eq-15.5}
This makes it easy to calculate
$$
u^2=-e^{-2i\theta}\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2.
$$ {#eq-15.6}
We can use this in Bernoulli's theorem for irrotational flow (in the absence of body forces) to find the pressure
$$
p =-\frac{\rho}{2}u^2+constant=\frac{\rho}{2}e^{-2i\theta}\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2+constant.
$$ {#eq-15.7}
The value of the constant is irrelevant because only pressure differences create forces. Substituting this expression
$$\begin{split}
dF_x-i\,dF_y&=p(\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)dl =p e^{i\theta}\,dl\\
&= \frac{\rho}{2}\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2e^{-i\theta}dl \\
&= \frac{\rho}{2}\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2(\cos\theta\,dl -i\sin\theta\,dl)\\
&=i\,\frac{\rho}{2}\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2dz.
\end{split}$$ {#eq-15.8}
where we used that
$$
dx=-\sin\theta\,dl,~~dy=-\cos\theta\,dl~\text{ and }~dz=dx+i\,dy.
$$ {#eq-15.9}
We can now integrate this along the aerofoil to get the total force on the aerofoil as
$$
F_x-iF_y=i\,\frac{\rho}{2}\oint_C\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2dz.
$$ {#eq-15.10}
Because we are integrating a holomorphic function, the result will be the same
no matter which contour $C$ we are using, as long as it encircles the aerofoil
once in a counterclockwise direction. We have thus derived Blasius' theorem.


## Kutta-Joukowski lift theorem

<iframe src="https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=c4830f0c-6356-4f16-ab8d-af790127db50&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=true&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

We now simplify the expression for the force acting on an aerofoil that we
derived in the previous subsection even further by considering the Laurent
expansion
$$
\frac{dw}{dz}=a_0+\frac{a_1}{z}+\frac{a_2}{z^2}+\cdots.
$$ {#eq-15.11}
(You can find a discussion of Laurent expansions in your
lecture notes from 'Functions of a complex argument'.) We know that the velocity
far away from the aerofoil (which we will denote as $\underline{u}(\infty)$) has
to be finite, and therefore the Laurent expansion of $dw/dz$ can not have any
terms with positive powers of $z$. Far away from the aerofoil we have
$$
\lim_{|z|\to\infty}\frac{dw}{dz}= a_0=u_x(\infty)-i\,u_y(\infty).
$$ {#eq-15.12}
We also get the Laurent expansion
$$
\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2dz=a_0^2+\frac{2a_0a_1}{z}+\frac{a_1^2+2a_0a_2}{z^2}+\dots.
$$ {#eq-15.13}
Using this in Blasius theorem and using Cauchy's residue theorem gives us
$$
F_x-iF_y=i\,\frac{\rho}{2}\oint_C\left(\frac{dw}{dz}\right)^2dz=-2\pi\rho\, a_0\,a_1.
$$ {#eq-fxy}
We get $a_1$ from the contour integral of $dw/dz$:
$$\begin{split}
2\pi i a_1&=\oint_C\frac{dw}{dz}dz=\oint_C(u_x-i\,u_y)(dx+i\,dy)\\
&=\oint(u_xdx+u_ydy)+\oint_C(iu_xdy-iu_ydx)\\
&=\oint_C\underline{u}\cdot d\underline{x}+i\oint_C\underline{\nabla}\psi\cdot d\underline{x}.
\end{split}$$ {#eq-15.15}
The second term vanishes. To see this consider integrating along the aerofoil.
Because the flow follows the surface of the aerofoil, this means that that
surface is a streamline. Thus the streamfunction $\psi$ is constant along the
contour, hence $\underline{\nabla}\psi\cdot d\underline{x}=0$. The remaining
first term is just the circulation $\Gamma$. Hence we have that
$$
a_1=\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi i}.
$$ {#eq-15.16}
Substituting our results for $a_0$ and $a_1$ into @eq-fxy  gives
$$
F_x-iF_y=i\rho(u_x(\infty)-i u_y(\infty))\Gamma,
$$ {#eq-15.17}
from which we can extract the real and imaginary parts to get our final result:
$$
F_x=\rho\,\Gamma u_y(\infty),~~~F_y=-\rho\,\Gamma u_x(\infty).
$$ {#eq-15.18}
As promised, the forces depend only on the circulation and the velocity far away from the aerofoil.

Let us check that this reproduces the results from @sec-magnus on the Magnus
effect. There we had $u_y(\infty)=0$ and thus $F_x=0$. Thus there is no drag
force. (In the real world of course there is drag, which will be created by the
turbulent wake behind the cylinder, but we are not modelling that.) We also had
$u_x(\infty)=a$ and $\Gamma=-2\pi b$ so that $F_y=2\pi\rho a b$, which
reproduces the old result in @eq-magnus .


## Conformal mappings

<iframe src="https://york.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=46c1c619-0459-4a00-ab17-af790127f7db&autoplay=false&offerviewer=true&showtitle=true&showbrand=false&captions=true&interactivity=all" height="405" width="720" style="border: 1px solid #464646;" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay"></iframe>

From the previous lecture we have a flow around a cylindrical aerofoil. We want
the flow around a less symmetrical shape that is rounded at the front but has a
tip at the end. This is illustrated in @fig-conformal. We are going to use a
conformal mapping that maps from one to the other.

![A conformal mapping $f$ from the region $D$ outside a disk $A$ to the region $\tilde{D}$ outside the cross section $\tilde{A}$ of an aerofoil.](conformal.png){width=90% #fig-conformal}

Let $A$ be the cross section of a cylindrical aerofoil, i.e., a closed disc,
with radius $R$, centred at $z=-\lambda$. Let $\tilde{A}$ be the desired cross
section of the aerofoil. Then $D=\mathbb{C}\setminus A$ and
$\tilde{D}=\mathbb{C}\setminus \tilde{A}$ are the regions outside the aerofoils.

Let $f:D\to\tilde{D}$ be a holomorphic invertible function. View this as a map
from the region in one complex plane to another, which we will refer to as the
$z$ plane and the $\tilde{z}$ plane respectively, where
$\tilde{z}=f(z)=\tilde{x}+i\tilde{y}$. We want to know what happens to the fluid
flow under this map. We introduce the complex potential on $\tilde{D}$ to be
everywhere identical to the complex potential at the corresponding point in $D$,
i.e.,
$$
 \tilde{w}(\tilde{z})=w(z)=w(f^{-1}(\tilde{z})).
$$ {#eq-15.19}
This is a holomorphic function on $\tilde{D}$. It gives us the vector potential
$\tilde{\phi}$ and the stream function $\tilde{\psi}$ on $\tilde{D}$ as usual:
$$
 \tilde{w}(\tilde{z})=\tilde{\phi}(\tilde{x},\tilde{y})+i\tilde{\psi}(\tilde{x},\tilde{y}).
$$ {#eq-15.20}
Because the stream function $\tilde{\psi}(\tilde{z})$ on $\tilde{D}$ takes the
same values as the original stream function $\psi$ on the corresponding point on
$D$, the stream lines on $D$ get mapped by $f$ to streamlines on $\tilde{D}$. We
can find the mapped velocity field on $\tilde{D}$ from the complex potential
$\tilde{w}$ as
$$\begin{split}
 \frac{d\tilde{w}}{d\tilde{z}}
 &=\tilde{u}_x-i\tilde{u}_y
 =\frac{d}{d\tilde{z}}w\left(f^{-1}(\tilde{z})\right)\\
 &=\frac{dw}{dz}\frac{df^{-1}(\tilde{z})}{d\tilde{z}}
 =\frac{dw/dz}{f'},
\end{split}$$ {#eq-uf}
where we used that the derivative of the inverse function $f^{-1}$ is the
reciprocal of the derivative of the function $f$. Thus we find that the
components of the velocity field are simply rescaled by $f'$ at every point.
 
We now consider how angles behave under the mapping $f$. See @fig-angles for a
drawing illustrating the following discussion. We consider an infinitesimal line
from some point $z_0$ to point $z_0+\delta z$ for some infinitesimally small
$\delta z$. This gets mapped into a line from $\tilde{z}_0=f(z_0)$ to
$$\begin{split}
 \tilde{z}_0+\delta\tilde{z}&=f(z_0+\delta z)\\
 &=f(z_0)+\delta z\,f'(z_0)+\frac{(\delta z)^2}{2}f''(z_0)+\\
 &\qquad\cdots 
 +\frac{(\delta z)^n}{n!}f^{(n)}(z_0)+\cdots
\end{split}$$ {#eq-15.22}
In the case where $f^{(n)}(z_0)=0$ for all $n<m$ and $f^{(m)}(z_0)\neq 0$ this
gives
$$
 \delta\tilde{z}=f(z_0+\delta z)=\frac{(\delta z)^m}{m!}f^{(m)}(z_0)+\text{ higher-order terms}.
$$ {#eq-15.23}
The higher-order terms can be neglected for infinitesimal $\delta z$. For the
angle that the line segments make with the horizontal we find
$$
 \operatorname{arg}(\delta \tilde{z})=m\,\operatorname{arg}(\delta z) + \operatorname{arg}(f^{(m)}(z_0)).
$$ {#eq-15.24}
 
![A figure illustrating the change in angle under the holomorphic mapping $f$.](angles.png){width=90% #fig-angles}
 
Let us now consider a second infinitesimal line element from $z_0$ to
$z_0+\delta z_2$, which gets mapped into a line from $\tilde{z}_0$ to
$\tilde{z}_0+\delta\tilde{z}_2$ and consider the angle
$$
 \theta = \operatorname{arg}(\delta z_2) - \operatorname{arg}(\delta z)
$$ {#eq-15.25}
between them. This gets mapped to
$$\begin{split}
 \tilde{\theta} &= \operatorname{arg}(\delta  \tilde{z}_2) - \operatorname{arg}(\delta  \tilde{z})\\
& =m\,\operatorname{arg}(\delta z_2) - m\,\operatorname{arg}(\delta z)=m\,\theta.
\end{split}$$ {#eq-mtheta}
Thus the angle is multiplied by the integer $m$. But $f'(z)\neq 0$ for all $z$
in $D$ because otherwise $f$ would not be invertible. Hence $m=1$ and all angles
are preserved. This is why such mappings by holomorphic invertible functions are
called __conformal mappings__.
 
## Joukouwski mapping

We want the aerofoil to have a cusp at the trailing edge, see Figure
@fig-conformal. We will see soon why that is important. At the cusp the angle
between the upper and lower surfaces of the aerofoil is $2\pi$. In the original
cylindrical aerofoil the angle is everywhere equal to $\pi$. So we need to
choose a conformal map $f$ that, when extended to the surface of the aerofoil,
has a vanishing derivative at the point $c=R-\lambda$ but a non-vanishing second
derivative,
$$
f'(c)=0~~~\text{ and }~~~f''(c)\neq 0,
$$ {#eq-fc1}
because then, according to @eq-mtheta , the angles at $z=c$ are doubled.

We also want the conformal mapping to not affect the flow far away from the
aerofoil. We know from @eq-uf  that the velocity is scaled by a factor of $f'$,
so we need
$$
\lim_{|z|\to\infty}f'(z)=1.
$$ {#eq-fc2}

A function $f$ that satisfies the conditions in @eq-fc1  and  @eq-fc2 is
$$
f(z)=z-\frac{c^2}{z}.
$$ {#eq-15.29}
It is holomorphic on $D$ because the poles at $z=\pm c$ are not in $D$. The
point $z=-c$ lies inside the aerofoil and the point $z=c$ on its surface.

We now start with the flow around the cylinder discussed in the section on the
Magnus effect, described by the complex potential
$$
w(z)=a\left(z+\frac{R^2}{z}\right)+ib\log z.
$$ {#eq-15.30}
We rotate everything by an angle $\alpha$ counterclockwise and shift the centre
of the cylinder to the left by $\lambda$ . This is achieved by replacing $z$ by
$(z+\lambda)e^{-i\alpha}$. We also make the argument of the logarithm
dimensionless by dividing by $R$, see discussion in section @sec-units. This
thus gives the flow on the left in @fig-jou.

![The Joukowski mapping $f$ maps the flow around the cylinder to the flow around the aerofoil.](joukowski.png){width=90% #fig-jou}

We set $b=-\Gamma/(2\pi R)$.
So we use
$$
w(z)=a\left((z+\lambda)e^{-i\alpha}+\frac{R^2}{z+\lambda}e^{i\alpha}\right)-\frac{i\Gamma}{2\pi R}\log\frac{z+\lambda}{R}.
$$ {#eq-15.31}
From the derivative of this complex potential
$$
\frac{dw}{dz}=a\left(e^{-i\alpha}-\dfrac{R^2}{(z+\lambda)^2}e^{i\alpha}\right)-\dfrac{i\Gamma}{2\pi}\dfrac{1}{z+\lambda}
$$ {#eq-15.32}
we see that far away we have constant flow at an angle $\alpha$ to the horizontal:
$$\begin{split}
\lim_{|z|\to\infty}\frac{dw}{dz}
&=a\,e^{-i\alpha}=a\cos\alpha-ia\sin\alpha\\
&=u_x(\infty)-iu_y(\infty).
\end{split}$$ {#eq-15.33}
By calculating the contour integral along a contour surrounding the aerofoil  using Cauchy's residue theorem we find
that the circulation is
$$
\oint_C\frac{dw}{dz}dz=2\pi i\left(-\dfrac{i\Gamma}{2\pi}\right)=\Gamma.
$$ {#eq-15.34}

We can now use @eq-uf  to find the velocity field after applying the conformal mapping $f$:
$$\begin{split}
 \frac{d\tilde{w}}{d\tilde{z}}
 &=\frac{dw/dz}{f'}\\
 &=\frac{a\left(e^{-i\alpha}-\dfrac{R^2}{(z+\lambda)^2}e^{i\alpha}\right)-\dfrac{i\Gamma}{2\pi}\dfrac{1}{z+\lambda}}
 {1-\dfrac{(R-\lambda)^2}{z^2}}.
\end{split}$$ {#eq-15.35}
We note that due to the zero of the denominator at $z=R-\lambda$ the velocity is infinite at that point unless the numerator
vanishes at that point, i.e., unless
$$
\Gamma = -4\pi a R\sin\alpha.
$$ {#eq-15.36}
The cusp at the rear of the aerofoil forces the airflow to have this particular
amount of circulation.

We can therefore now use the Kutta-Joukowski theorem to determine the lift
force:
$$\begin{split}
F_x&=\rho\Gamma u_y(\infty)=4\pi\rho \,a^2\, R\sin\alpha(-\sin\alpha),\\
F_y&=-\rho\Gamma u_y(\infty)=4\pi\rho \,a^2\, R\sin\alpha(\cos\alpha).
\end{split}
$$ {#eq-15.37}

We used the fact that the mapping did not change the velocity far away and did
not change the circulation because $\tilde{w}(\tilde{z})=w(z)$ and thus
$$
\oint_C \frac{d\tilde{w}}{d\tilde{z}}d\tilde{z}=\oint_{f^{-1}(C)}\frac{dw}{dz}dz=\Gamma,
$$ {#eq-15.38}
due to the fact that the contour $f^{-1}(C)$ also surrounds the cylinder in the
counterclockwise direction.

We have thus found that the lift force is acting at an angle $\alpha$ to the
vertical and has a magnitude of
$$
4\pi\rho \,a^2\, R\sin\alpha.
$$ {#eq-15.39}
