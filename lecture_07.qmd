## Two-dimensional wave equation

Consider an infinite two-dimensional membrane of homogeneous density $\rho$
(mass per unit area, measured in $kg/m^2$). In the equilibrium state, it is flat
and coincides with the $(x,y)$ plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We assume that it is
stretched to a tension $T$ (force per unit length, measured in $N/m$). This
means that for any line on the surface of the membrane, the part of the membrane
on one side of the line exerts a force $T$ (per unit length of the line) on the
other part of the membrane (on the other side of the line), and the direction of
the force is perpendicular to the line.

The perturbed membrane may be described as a time-dependent surface $z=z(x,y,t)$
in $\mathbb{R}^3$, where $z(x,y,t)$ is the vertical (in the $z$ direction)
displacement of the membrane at point $(x,y)$ and time $t$. To derive the
equation of motion, we consider a small element of the membrane of size $\delta
x$ and $\delta y$ in $x$ and $y$, as shown in @fig-membrane.

We assume that there is only transverse motion of the membrane and that the
partial derivatives $\partial_x z$ and $\partial_y z$ are small:
$\vert\partial_x z\vert \ll 1$ and $\vert\partial_y z\vert \ll 1$. Almost the
same arguments as those in @sec-1.1 lead to the conclusion that the vertical
component of the force is a sum of two terms: $T \delta y \, \partial_x^2 z \,
\delta x$ (coming from the tension forces that are nearly parallel to the
$x$-axis in @fig-membrane) and $T \delta x \, \partial_y^2 z \, \delta y$ (coming
from the tension forces that are nearly parallel to the $y$-axis in
@fig-membrane). So, Newton's equation of motion ($ma=F$) yields
$$
(\rho \, \delta x \, \delta y)\partial_t^2 z = T \delta y \, \partial_x^2 z \, \delta x + T \delta x \, \partial_y^2 z \, \delta y.
$$ {#eq-7.1}
Dividing this by $\delta x \, \delta y$ and $\rho$, we get the governing
equation for the membrane:
$$
 \partial_t^2 z = \frac{T}{\rho} \left( \partial_x^2 \, z  +  \partial_y^2 \, z\right)
$$ {#eq-memb1}
or, equivalently,
$$
\partial_t^2 z  - c^2 \nabla^2 z = 0, \quad c=\sqrt{\frac{T}{\rho}}.
$$ {#eq-memb2}
Here $c$ in the wave speed and $\nabla^2$ is the Laplace operator:
$$
\nabla^2= \partial_x^2  + \partial_y^2.
$$ {#eq-7.4}
Sometimes, the Laplace operator is also denoted by $\Delta$ (i.e.  $\Delta =
\nabla^2 = \partial_x^2  + \partial_y^2$).
@eq-memb2 is the two-dimensional wave equation.

## Energy of membrane

The energy density of the membrane is
$$
\mathcal{E}(x,y,t)=\frac{\rho}{2}(\partial_t z)^2+\frac{T}{2}\left((\partial_x z)^2+(\partial_y z)^2\right),
$$ {#eq-7.5}
where the term involving the density $\rho$ is the kinetic energy density
$\mathcal{E}_K$ and the term involving the tension $T$ is the potential energy
density $\mathcal{E}_V$. The latter we could write in vector notation as
$\mathcal{E}_v=T|\nabla z|^2/2.$

To check this, we check whether this $\mathcal{E}$ satisfies a conservation
equation. So we calculate
$$\begin{split}
\frac{d\mathcal{E}}{dt} &=\rho\, (\partial_t z) ( \partial_t^2 z) +T\,(\partial_t\partial_x z)(\partial_x z)+T\,(\partial_t\partial_y z)(\partial_y z)  \\ 
&=T\, (\partial_t z) (\partial_x^2z+\partial_y^2z) +T\,\left((\partial_t\partial_x z)(\partial_x z)+\,(\partial_t\partial_y z)(\partial_y z)\right)  \\
&=-\partial_x\left(-T(\partial_xz)(\partial_tz)\right)-\partial_y\left(-T(\partial_xz)(\partial_tz)\right),
\end{split}$$ {#eq-7.6}
where for the second equality we have used the wave equation. We introduce the
two-dimensional energy flux density vector
$\mathcal{F}=(\mathcal{F}_x,\mathcal{F}_y)$ with
$$
\mathcal{F}_x =-T(\partial_xz)(\partial_tz),~~~~ \mathcal{F}_y=-T(\partial_yz)(\partial_tz).
$$ {#eq-7.7}
In terms of this we have derived the conservation equation
 $$
\frac{d\mathcal{E}}{dt} =-\nabla\cdot\mathcal{F}.
$$ {#eq-7.8}

To understand how this two-dimensional conservation equation leads to energy conservation let us look
at the energy in a  region $R$ in the $(x,y)$ plane. 
The energy in this region is given by
$$
E=\int\!\!\int_{R} \mathcal{E} dA.
$$ {eq-memb4}
Here $dA=dx \, dy$ is the area element. The rate of change in the energy is then
$$\begin{split}
\frac{dE}{dt} &=\int\!\!\int_{D} \partial_t\mathcal{E} dA =- \int\!\!\int_{D} \nabla\mathcal{F} dA \\
&=-\int_{\partial R} \mathcal{F}\cdot\vn\, ds  \qquad (\text{using the divergence theorem}). 
\end{split}$$ {#eq-7.9}
where $\vn$ is the outward unit normal on $\partial D$ and $ds$ is the line
element on $\partial D$. So again we see that the change of energy in a region
is equal to the net flow of energy into the region.

## Travelling plane waves

A 2D wave is a plane wave if $z(x,y,t)$ varies only in one spatial direction,
say, parallel to a constant unit vector $\vn=(n_x,n_y)$  (and $z(x,y,t)$ is
constant in the direction perpendicular to $\vn$). This means that
$$
z(x,y,t)=f(\vn\cdot\vx -ct)=f(n_x x+n_y y -ct)
$$ {#eq-plane1}
describes a plane wave travelling with wave speed $c$ in the direction of vector
$\vn$.

Let's verify that @eq-plane1 is a solution of the 2D wave equation. We have
$$\begin{split}
\partial_t^2 \, z &=\partial_t^2 \, f(\vn\cdot\vx -ct)=f''(\vn\cdot\vx -ct) \, c^2,  \\
\partial_x^2 \, z &=\partial_x^2 \, f(\vn\cdot\vx -ct)=f''(\vn\cdot\vx -ct) \, n_x^2, \\
\partial_y^2 \, z &=\partial_y^2 \, f(\vn\cdot\vx -ct)=f''(\vn\cdot\vx -ct) \, n_y^2. 
\end{split}$$ {#eq-7.12}
Hence,
$$
\partial_t^2 \, z -c^2 \, \left(\partial_x^2 \, z + \partial_y^2 \, z\right)=
c^2 \, f''(\vn\cdot\vx -ct)\left(1- n_x^2-n_y^2\right)=0
$$ {#eq-7.13}
(as $\vn$ is a unit vector, i.e. $n_x^2 + n_y^2=1$).

The _harmonic plane wave_ corresponds to the choice $f(s)=e^{iks}$, so that
$$
z(x,y,t)=e^{ik(\vn\cdot\vx -ct)}= e^{i(\vk\cdot\vx -\omega(\vk)t)},
$$ {#eq-plane2}
where $\vk=k \, \vn$ is called the _wave vector_. The dispersion relation follows from
@eq-plane2: $\omega(\vk)=c \, \vert \vk\vert$.
