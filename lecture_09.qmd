Let's find normal mode solution for a circular membrane of radius $a$ with fixed
boundary (see @fig-polar_co). Mathematically, we need to solve the wave equation
(@eq-rectangular1) in the disc of radius $a$, i.e. in region
$D=\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2\vert r^2=x^2+y^2 < a^2 \}$. It is convenient to use
polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$, defined as (see @fig-polar_co)
$$
x=r\cos\theta, \quad y=r\sin\theta.
$$ {#eq-9.1}

![Circular membrane with radius $a$ and polar coordinates.](polar_coords.png){width=60% #fig-polar_co}

Let
$$
Z(r, \theta, t) = z\left(x(r,\theta), y(r, \theta),t\right),
$$ {#eq-9.2}
i.e.,  $Z(r, \theta, t)$ is a solution of the wave equation in $D$, expressed in
terms of polar coordinates.

We know that the wave equation can be written in vector notation using the Laplace
operator $\nabla^2$ as
$$
\partial_t^2 z - c^2 \nabla^2 z =0.
$$ {#eq-9.3}
It is well-known (see, e.g., Theorem 3.43 in the Spring 2020 Calculus notes or Theorem 4.6 in the Spring 2021 Calculus notes) that the
Laplacian in polar coordinates is given by
$$
\nabla^2 = \partial_r^2 + \frac{1}{r}\, \partial_r + \frac{1}{r^2} \, \partial_{\theta}^2.
$$ {#eq-9.4}
Therefore, the 2D wave equation in polar coordinates has the form
$$
\partial_t^2 Z - c^2
\left(\partial_r^2 Z + \frac{1}{r}\, \partial_r Z + \frac{1}{r^2} \, \partial_{\theta}^2 Z\right)= 0.
$$ {#eq-circular2}
Our aim is to solve it subject to the boundary condition @eq-circular1. As
in the preceding section, we employ the method of separation of variables, i.e.
we assume that
$$
Z(r, \theta, t)=R(r)\Theta(\theta)T(t).
$$ {#eq-9.6}
Substituting this into @eq-circular2, we find that
$$
R\Theta T''=c^2\left(R''\Theta T + \frac{1}{r} \, R'\Theta T + \frac{1}{r^2} \, R\Theta'' T\right) 
$$ {#eq-9.7}
Dividing by $R\Theta T$ gives
$$
 \frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2\left(\frac{R''(r)}{R(r)} + \frac{R'(r)}{r R(r)}+\frac{\Theta''(\theta)}{r^2\Theta(\theta)}\right).
$$ {#eq-9.8}
Employing the same arguments as in the preceding section, we conclude that
$$
\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2\left(\frac{R''(r)}{R(r)} + \frac{R'(r)}{r R(r)}+
\frac{\Theta''(\theta)}{r^2\Theta(\theta)}\right)
= -k^2 c^2
$$ {#eq-9.9}
for some constant $k$. This means that we have the ODE
$$
T''(t)=-k^2 c^2 \, T(t)
$$ {#eq-circular3}
and the equation
$$
\frac{R''(r)}{R(r)} + \frac{R'(r)}{r R(r)}+
\frac{\Theta''(\theta)}{r^2\Theta(\theta)} = -k^2 
$$ {#eq-circular4}
The general solution of @eq-rectangular3 is (cf. @eq-rectangular7)
$$
T(t)=F \, \sin(k c t)+G \, \cos(k c t)
$$ {#eq-circular5}
where $F$ and $G$ are arbitrary constants.

Rewriting @eq-circular5 as
$$
\frac{r^2R''(r)+rR'(r)}{R(r)} + k^2 r^2 = -\frac{\Theta''(\theta)}{\Theta(\theta)},
$$ {#eq-9.13}
we conclude that for this equation to hold for all $r$ and $\theta$, both sides
must be equal to a constant, which we choose to be $n^2$ (for some constant
$n$), i.e.
$$
r^2\left(\frac{R''(r)}{R(r)} + \frac{R'(r)}{r R(r)} \right)+ k^2 r^2 = n^2, \quad
-\frac{\Theta''(\theta)}{\Theta(\theta)}= n^2
$$ {#eq-9.14}
(the constant, $n^2$, cannot be negative because, with a negative constant, it
will be impossible to obtain a solution). Thus, we we have obtained the
following two ODEs:
$$
R''(r) + \frac{1}{r} \, R'(r) +\left(k^2 -\frac{\lambda^2}{r^2}\right) R(r) = 0
$$ {#eq-circular6}
and
$$
\Theta''(\theta)=-n^2 \Theta(\theta) .
$$ {#eq-circular7}

The general solution of @eq-circular7 is
$$
\Theta(\theta) = A\sin(n \theta)+B\cos(n \theta)
$$ {#eq-circtheta}
for arbitrary constants $A$ and $B$. 
We impose the _periodicity_ condition
$$
\Theta(\theta+2\pi) = \Theta(\theta) \quad \text{for all} \ \ \theta.
$$
This is a natural condition because $(r,\theta)$ and $(r,\theta+2\pi)$ represent
a single point in domain $D$. Thus we require $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. In fact we only
need to consider $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{ 0\}$ because of the symmetry of $\sin$
and $\cos$.

@eq-circular6 has the form
$$
r^2\,R''(r) + r \, R'(r) +\left(r^2\,k^2 -n^2\right) R(r) = 0.
$$ {#eq-circular11}
It is a well-known equation, called the Bessel differential equation. Its
solutions are not elementary functions. We are only interested in solutions that
are finite at $r=0$. There is a whole family of such solutions,
$$
R(r) =J_n(kr),
$$ {#eq-circular12}
where $J_n$ is the $n$th Bessel functions of the first type. We have already
determined above that we are only interested in the cases where
$n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$.

Next we need to impose the zero Dirichlet boundary condition (the edge of the
membrane is fixed)
$$
Z(a, \theta, t) =  0.
$$ {#eq-circular1}
To do this, we only need to know that each Bessel function has an infinite
number of zeros. A plot of the first few Bessel functions of the 1st kind is
shown in @fig-bessel.

![Plot of the first four Bessel functions of the 1st kind.](bessel){#fig-bessel}

We denote the $m$th zero of the $n$th Bessel function of the 1st kind by
$k_{nm}$. We have
$$\begin{split}
R(a)=0 \quad &\Rightarrow \quad J_n(k\,a)=0\\
&\Rightarrow \quad k\,a=k_{nm}\\
&\Rightarrow \quad k=\frac{k_{nm}}{a}
\end{split}$$
for $m\in\mathbb{N}$. 

Finally, combining the above with @eq-circular5 and @eq-circtheta, we obtain the
following solutions (that satisfy the required boundary condition):
$$\begin{split}
Z_{nm}(r,\theta,t)=&J_m\left(k_{nm} \frac{r}{a}\right)\\
\cdot&\Big[  \sin(n\theta)
\left(F_{nm} \, \sin\left(\frac{k_{nm}}{a} c t\right) + G_{nm} \, \cos\left(\frac{k_{nm}}{a} c t\right)\right)\\
&+\cos(n\theta)
\left(\tilde{F}_{nm} \, \sin\left(\frac{k_{nm}}{a} c t\right) + \tilde{G}_{nm} \, \cos\left(\frac{k_{nm}}{a} c t\right)\right)\Big]
\end{split}$${#eq-circular14}
where $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, $m\in\mathbb{N}$ and $F_{nm}$, $G_{nm}$, $\tilde{F}_{nm}$ and
$\tilde{G}_{nm}$ are arbitrary real constants. Solutions in the form @eq-circular14 are
the normal modes of vibrations of the circular membrane. Once normal modes are
known, we can find a solution satisfying some initial conditions by using a
linear combination of the normal modes
$$
Z(r,\theta,t)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}Z_{nm}(r,\theta,t).
$$ {#eq-circular15}
Note that constants $F_{nm}$, $G_{nm}$, $\tilde{F}_{nm}$ and
$\tilde{G}_{nm}$ (in the formula for $Z_{nm}$
for each $n,m$) are still arbitrary. To determine them, we need to substitute
@eq-circular15 into initial conditions. This will lead to the so-called
Fourier-Bessel series. This is based on the identities
$$
\int_0^aJ_n\left(k_{nm}\frac{r}{a}\right)J_n\left(k_{nl}\frac{r}{a}\right)r\,dr
=\delta_{ml}\frac{a^2}{2}\left(J_{n+1}(k_{nm})\right)^2.
$$ {#eq-9.23}
