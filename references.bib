	isbn = {978-0-8218-2039-1},
	abstract = {This book is based on an undergraduate course taught at the {IAS}/Park City Mathematics Institute (Utah) on linear and nonlinear waves. The first part of the text overviews the concept of a wave, describes one-dimensional waves using functions of two variables, provides an introduction to partial differential equations, and discusses computer-aided visualization techniques. The second part of the book discusses traveling waves, leading to a description of solitary waves and soliton solutions of the Klein-Gordon and Korteweg-{deVries} equations. The wave equation is derived to model the small vibrations of a taut string, and solutions are constructed via d'Alembert's formula and Fourier series.The last part of the book discusses waves arising from conservation laws. After deriving and discussing the scalar conservation law, its solution is described using the method of characteristics, leading to the formation of shock and rarefaction waves. Applications of these concepts are then given for models of traffic flow. The intent of this book is to create a text suitable for independent study by undergraduate students in mathematics, engineering, and science. The content of the book is meant to be self-contained, requiring no special reference material. Access to computer software such as {MathematicaR}, {MATLABR}, or {MapleR} is recommended, but not necessary. Scripts for {MATLAB} applications will be available via the Web. Exercises are given within the text to allow further practice with selected topics.},

	abstract = {This classic text offers a thorough, clear and methodical introductory exposition of the mathematical theory of fluid motion, useful in applications to both hydrodynamics and aerodynamics. Departing radically from traditional approaches, the author bases the treatment on vector methods and notation with their natural consequence in two dimensions — the complex variable.New features in this edition include: a chapter bringing together various exact treatments of two-dimensional motion with a free surface in a gravitational field, followed by one dealing with approximations (mostly linearized) relevant to this but with emphasis on waves; a chapter on tensor methods applied to the flow of viscous fluids; a chapter on flow with small Reynolds' number, including an account of a novel application of the complex variable to Stokes' flow; and an outline of the theory of two-dimensional laminar flow in a boundary layer.Prerequisites are restricted to a knowledge of elementary calculus since any additional mathematics is introduced as required, making this a self-contained treatment. Nearly 400 diagrams help illustrate the text and over 600 exercises are collected into sets of examples at the end of each chapter.},

	abstract = {The study of the dynamics of fluids is a central theme of modern applied mathematics. It is used to model a vast range of physical phenomena and plays a vital role in science and engineering. This textbook provides a clear introduction to both the theory and application of fluid dynamics, and will be suitable for all undergraduates coming to the subject for the first time. Prerequisites are few: a basic knowledge of vector calculus, complex analysis, and simple methods for solving differential equations are all that is needed. Throughout, numerous exercises (with hints and answers) illustrate the main ideas and serve to consolidate the reader's understanding of the subject. The book's wide scope (including inviscid and viscous flows, waves in fluids, boundary layer flow, and instability in flow) and frequent references to experiments and the history of the subject, ensures that this book provides a comprehensive and absorbing introduction to the mathematical study of fluid behaviour.},

	isbn = {978-1-4987-0262-1},
	abstract = {Fads are as common in mathematics as in any other human activity, and it is always difficult to separate the enduring from the ephemeral in the achievements of one’s own time. An unfortunate effect of the predominance of fads is that if a student doesn’t learn about such worthwhile topics as the wave equation, Gauss’s hypergeometric function, the gamma function, and the basic problems of the calculus of variations—among others—as an undergraduate, then he/she is unlikely to do so later.  The natural place for an informal acquaintance with such ideas is a leisurely introductory course on differential equations. Specially designed for just such a course, Differential Equations with Applications and Historical Notes takes great pleasure in the journey into the world of differential equations and their wide range of applications. The author—a highly respected educator—advocates a careful approach, using explicit explanation to ensure students fully comprehend the subject matter. With an emphasis on modeling and applications, the long-awaited Third Edition of this classic textbook presents a substantial new section on Gauss’s bell curve and improves coverage of Fourier analysis, numerical methods, and linear algebra. Relating the development of mathematics to human activity—i.e., identifying why and how mathematics is used—the text includes a wealth of unique examples and exercises, as well as the author’s distinctive historical notes, throughout. A solutions manual is available upon qualifying course adoption.

	abstract = {How can the drag coefficient of a car be reduced? What factors govern the variation in the shape of the Earth's magnetosphere? What is the basis of weather prediction? These are examples of problems that can only be tackled with a sound knowledge of the principles and methods of fluid dynamics. This important discipline has applications which range from the study of the large-scale properties of the galaxies to the design of high precision engineering components. This book introduces the subject of fluid dynamics from the first principles. The first eleven chapters cover all the basic ideas of fluid mechanics, explaining carefully the modelling and mathematics needed. The last six chapters illustrate applications of this material to linearised sound and water waves, to high speed flow of air, to non-linear water waves on channels, and to aerofoil theory. Over 350 diagrams have been used to illustrate key points. Exercises are included to help develop and reinforce the reader's understanding of the material presented. References at the ends of each chapter serve not only to guide readers to more detailed texts, but also list where alternative descriptions of the salient points in the chapter may be found. This book is an undergraduate text for second or third year students of mathematics or mathematical physics, who are taking a first course in fluid dynamics.},
