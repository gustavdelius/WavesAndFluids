    "text": "Welcome\nThese are the lecture notes for Waves and Fluids, part of the 2nd year Applied Maths module at the University of York in Spring 2023. Each chapter in these notes corresponds to one lecture.\nThese notes will be periodically revised. Whenever you spot something that is not quite right, please email me at gustav.delius@york.ac.uk or submit your correction in the correction form at https://forms.gle/w17c19vWnM7wpLpz7.\n\nIf you want to print these notes you should download the pdf version.\n\nThis module consists of two topics: Waves and Fluids. In the first half of the term, we will focus on Waves, while in the second half, we will delve into Fluids. The topics are interconnected by their use of partial differential equations to describe real-world phenomena in space and time.\nAn alternative title for this module could be “Introduction to Continuum Dynamics”. It is designed to introduce you to the mathematical modeling and analysis of the behaviour of materials that are treated as continua, or continuous media. Unlike Newtonian Dynamics and Classical Dynamics, which deal with individual particles, Continuum Dynamics deals with emergent phenomena created by the interaction of large numbers of particles. It employs mathematical tools such as partial differential equations.\nThe concepts and methods presented in Continuum Dynamics form the basis of a large part of Applied Mathematics. You will encounter them again in future Applied Mathematics modules, and they are also used in fields such as biology, ecology, medicine, sociology, and economics. The examples presented in this module are less important than the way of thinking they introduce.\nThe goal of this module is to equip you with the skills and knowledge to apply mathematics to new phenomena in the real world. In your third and fourth year, you will have the opportunity to deepen this ability through various modules.\nThroughout this module, we shall use SI units: length is measured in meters (m), time in seconds (s), mass in kilograms (kg)."

    "text": "Waves play a fundamental role in our universe, as they are the only means by which information can propagate through space and time. Some examples of waves that carry information are well-known, such as sound waves, light waves, radio waves, and the electrical waves that travel along our neurons. Other examples are less obvious, such as the waves that describe the motion of particles in quantum mechanics and the gravitational waves that convey the effects of gravity.\nBecause waves travel at a finite speed, information can only propagate at the speed of the wave. This has profound implications, as we see in the theory of special relativity. For instance, we can observe distant events in the past because some of the light waves that were emitted soon after the Big Bang, roughly 16 billion years ago, are only now reaching us. These waves are strongly red-shifted and detectable as microwaves.\nThe study of waves is not only important from a theoretical perspective, but also from a practical standpoint. Waves play a vital role in our modern technological world. Advances in our understanding of how to generate and control electromagnetic waves have led to the development of essential technologies such as radio, radar, and mobile phones.\nFurthermore, understanding how waves propagate can also help us prepare for and prevent potential threats. For instance, studying how pests spread in the form of invasion waves into previously uninfected areas can help us develop effective interventions to prevent their spread. Similarly, understanding how density waves form in traffic flow and lead to traffic jams can help us design interventions to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.\nBy studying waves, we can gain insights into the underlying mechanisms that govern a wide range of phenomena, from the behaviour of subatomic particles to the dynamics of traffic flow. These insights can be applied in various fields, including engineering, medicine, and environmental science. By deepening our understanding of waves, we can continue to make advancements in technology and address real-world challenges in a more effective manner."

    "section": "1.1 Why waves on a string?",
    "text": "1.1 Why waves on a string?\nThe great diversity of waves in nature means that we need to choose some concrete wave phenomenon to concentrate on to start our investigation. In this module we will concentrate on the waves on a string (think of a guitar string) and generalise to waves on a membrane (think of the membrane of a drum). By studying this in detail you will develop the intuition and the skills that will allow you to understand other wave phenomena later. We’ll come back to waves at the end of the part on Fluid Dynamics when we study waves on the surface of a fluid.\nPersonally I like studying vibrating strings because they are at the foundation of superstring theory. This is a “Theory of Everything” that posits that elementary particles are actually tiny strings, with different vibrational states corresponding to different elementary particles. As a Ph.D. student I showed how, if these strings move in certain higher-dimensional group supermanifolds, they behave like the elementary particles of our standard model of particle physics, including the chiral fermions. If we ignore the bit about group supermanifolds for the moment, the maths behind string theory is no more complicated than the maths we will discuss in this module and the partner module on quantum mechanics.\nWe consider a flexible, elastic string of linear density \\(\\rho\\) (mass per unit length), which undergoes small transverse vibrations. (For example, it can be a guitar string.) The transverse vibrations mean that the displacements of each small element of the string is perpendicular to its length. We assume that the string does not move longitudinally (i.e. parallel to its length). Let \\(y(x, t)\\) be its displacement from equilibrium position at time \\(t\\) and position \\(x\\) (see Fig. Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A string stretched in the \\(x\\)-direction and vibrating in the \\(y\\)-direction.\n\n\nThe string is sufficiently simple so that we can understand it by pure thought. We will derive from first principles a PDE that describes its motion (the wave equation) and then solve it for various initial conditions. I find it amazing that this is possible.\nTo achieve this mathematical understanding we will need to make several simplifications and approximations. For example, we neglect that the string is made up of lots of individual atoms and instead we will pretend that the mass is spread out continuously along the string. This is known as the continuum approximation and we will meet this again in the fluid dynamics part of this module.\nTo derive the equation of motion of the string we first need to discuss the force acting on it which we will do in the next section. Then in the section after that we can plug this into Newton’s second law and out pops the wave equation. Along the way we will make approximations that allow us to linearise the equations."

    "section": "1.2 Linearized tension force",
    "text": "1.2 Linearized tension force\nWe consider a small segment of the string between any two points \\(x\\) and at \\(x+\\delta x\\) as shown in Fig. Figure 1.2. We want to determine the force that is acting on this segment, so that we can later determine its motion using Newton’s second law. We will concentrate on only the tension force of the string and ignore less important effects like gravity, friction, or stiffness.\nWe assume that the tension force \\(\\boldsymbol{T}(x)\\) has constant magnitude throughout the string: \\(|\\boldsymbol{T}(x)|=T\\). However its direction varies along the string, because it always acts in the tangential direction. At interior points the tension force pulling to one side will balance that pulling in the other direction. The net tension force on the segment will thus be determined by the tension forces at its ends. We have drawn these forces schematically in Figure Figure 1.2 where we have also split them into their \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The tension forces acting on a segment of the string between \\(x\\) and \\(x+\\delta x\\).\n\n\nThe total force acting on the segment is \\[\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{T}(x+\\delta x)-\\boldsymbol{T}(x). \\tag{1.1}\\] We first consider the \\(y\\) component \\[T_y(x) = T\\sin\\theta(x), \\tag{1.2}\\] where \\(\\theta(x)\\) is the angle that the string makes with the horizontal at \\(x\\). The slope of the string at \\(x\\) is \\[\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = \\tan\\theta(x). \\tag{1.3}\\] We are now going to simplify the expressions by assuming that the slope and thus \\(\\theta\\) is small, \\(\\theta<<1\\). Then, by Taylor expansion, \\[\\sin\\theta = \\theta + O(\\theta^3), ~~~\\tan\\theta = \\theta + O(\\theta^2). \\tag{1.4}\\] We ignore all terms that are higher order in \\(\\theta\\). This is known as the linear approximation. It is done very often, because it leads to linear equations that are so much easier to solve. So \\[\\begin{split}\nF_y&=T_y(x+\\delta x) - T_y(x) \\\\\n&= T\\sin\\theta(x+\\delta x) -T\\sin\\theta(x)\\\\\n&\\approx T\\left(\\theta(x+\\delta x)-\\theta(x)\\right).\n\\end{split} \\tag{1.5}\\] We do another Taylor expansion and ignore higher-order terms in \\(\\delta x\\), which is fine because we want to look at only an infinitesimally small segment of string. \\[\\begin{split}\\theta(x+\\delta x)&=\\theta(x)+\\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}+O(\\delta x)^2\\\\\n&\\approx \\theta(x)+\\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}.\\end{split} \\tag{1.6}\\] Substituting this into Eq. 1.5 gives \\[F_y\\approx T \\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}. \\tag{1.7}\\] We would like to express this in terms of \\(y\\) instead of \\(\\theta\\), which we can do by observing that \\[\\theta\\approx\\tan\\theta=\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}, \\tag{1.8}\\] so we finally have \\[F_y\\approx T\\,\\delta x\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}. \\tag{1.9}\\]\nWe deal with the \\(x\\) component of the force similarly, using the Taylor expansion of \\(\\cos\\theta=1+O(\\theta^2)\\): \\[\\begin{split}F_x&=T_x(x+\\delta x)-T_x(x)\\\\\n&=T\\cos\\theta(x+\\delta x)-T\\cos\\theta(x)\\\\\n&\\approx T-T=0.\\end{split} \\tag{1.10}\\] So in our approximation of small slope, there is no movement in the \\(x\\) direction. The string vibrates purely transversally."

    "text": "2.1 Characteristic coordinates\nTo solve the wave equation we use the method of characteristics, which involves a change of variables that makes the equation much simpler. We change from the variables \\(x\\) and \\(t\\) to the characteristic coordinates \\[\n  \\xi=x+ct,\\quad \\eta=x-ct.\n\\tag{2.2}\\] By this we mean that for any function \\(y\\) that depends on the variables \\(x\\) and \\(t\\) we can introduce a function \\(\\tilde{y}\\) that depends on the variables \\(\\xi\\) and \\(\\eta\\) in such a way that it has the same values as \\(y\\): \\[\ny(x,t)=\\tilde{y}(\\xi(x,t), \\eta(x,t)) \\text{ for all }x,t.\n\\tag{2.3}\\] It is a conventional abuse of notation to drop the tilde and denote both functions by \\(y\\). We will follow this abuse of notation.\nWe need to express the derivatives with respect to \\(t\\) and \\(x\\) via the derivatives with respect to \\(\\xi\\) and \\(\\eta\\). This is done using the chain rule: \\[\\begin{split}\n\\partial_t \\, y\n&=\\frac{\\partial {y}}{\\partial {\\xi}} \\, \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial t} +\n\\frac{\\partial {y}}{\\partial {\\eta}} \\, \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t}\\\\\n&= c \\left( \\partial_{\\xi} -  \\partial_{\\eta}\\right) {y}\n\\end{split} \\tag{2.4}\\] and \\[\\begin{split}\n\\partial_x \\, y\n&=\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial {\\xi}} \\, \\frac{\\partial \\xi}{\\partial x} +\n\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial {\\eta}} \\, \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x}\\\\\n&= \\left( \\partial_{\\xi} +  \\partial_{\\eta}\\right) y.\n\\end{split} \\tag{2.5}\\] Hence \\[\n\\partial_t = c \\left( \\partial_{\\xi} -  \\partial_{\\eta}\\right),~~~\n\\partial_x =  \\partial_{\\xi} +  \\partial_{\\eta}.\n\\tag{2.6}\\] Substituting these into the wave equation, we find that \\[\nc^2\\left(\\partial_{\\xi} - \\partial_{\\eta}\\right)^2 y -\nc^2\\left(\\partial_{\\xi} + \\partial_{\\eta}\\right)^2 y = 0.\n\\tag{2.7}\\] Expanding the squares and cancelling terms gives \\[\n-4c^2 \\partial_{\\xi} \\partial_{\\eta} y = 0.\n\\tag{2.8}\\] We can divide both sides by the nonzero constant \\(-4c^2\\). Thus the wave equation simplifies to \\[\n\\partial_{\\xi} \\partial_{\\eta} y = 0 .\n\\tag{2.9}\\]\nWhile here we have seen that the method of characteristics simplifies the wave equation, its applications extend far beyond this specific example. The method of characteristics can be used to solve a wide range of partial differential equations that arise in various areas of applied mathematics, including fluid dynamics. It can also be used to study the behaviour of complex systems, such as traffic flow, chemical reactions, and population dynamics. The key idea behind the method of characteristics is to transform a partial differential equation into a system of ordinary differential equations along characteristic curves, which can then be solved using standard techniques."

    "text": "3.3 Reflection at a change of density\nConsider two semi-infinite strings joined at the origin. The string on the left (\\(x<0\\)) has constant density \\(\\rho_1\\) and the string on the right (\\(x>0\\)) has constant density \\(\\rho_2\\). Let \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) be the displacements of the two strings. Since the strings have different densities, the wave speed in the two strings will be different: \\[\nc_1=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\rho_1}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\nc_2=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\rho_2}}.\n\\tag{3.12}\\] Suppose that we have a wave travelling to the right on the first string (an incident wave). When the wave meets the change in density, it will be partially reflected (back to the region \\(x<0\\)) and partially transmitted (forward to the region \\(x>0\\)). Waves travelling in the interval \\(x\\in(-\\infty,0)\\) are described by the wave equation with wave speed \\(c_1\\); waves travelling in the interval \\(x\\in(0,\\infty)\\) are described by the wave equation with wave speed \\(c_2\\). This is illustrated in Figure Figure 3.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: A right-moving wave being partially reflected and partially transmitted at the interface between two strings with wave velocities \\(c_1=1\\) (on the left half-line) and \\(c_2=2\\) (on the right half-line). Dashed line: incident right-moving wave. Solid line: wave interacting with the interface. Dashdotted line: partially reflected left-moving and partially transmitted right-moving wave.\n\n\nTherefore, we can write \\[\ny(x,t)=\\begin{cases}\ny_1(x,t)=f_I(x-c_1 t) + f_R(x+c_1 t), &x<0 \\\\\ny_2(x,t)=f_T(x-c_2 t), &x>0\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{3.13}\\] where \\(f_I\\), \\(f_R\\) and \\(f_T\\) represent the incident, reflected and transmitted waves, respectively. At the point of contact of the two strings (\\(x=0\\)), we impose the following two conditions: \\[\ny_1(0,t) = y_2(0,t) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ t,\n\\tag{3.14}\\] \\[\n\\partial_x y_1(0,t) = \\partial_x y_2(0,t) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ t.\n\\tag{3.15}\\] Condition 3.14 says that the solution for the combined string should be continuous at \\(x=0\\) (because the strings are attached to each other at the point). Condition 3.15 states that the slopes of the strings at \\(x=0\\) should be the same (if this is not so, there will be a finite force applied to an infinitesimal part of the combined string at \\(x=0\\), producing unphysical infinite acceleration).\nSuppose that the incident wave is given, i.e. the function of one variable \\(f_I\\) is known. Can we find \\(f_R\\) and \\(f_T\\)?\nSubstitution of Eq. 3.13 into condition Eq. 3.14 yields \\[\nf_I(-c_1 t) + f_R(c_1 t) = f_T(-c_2 t) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ t\n\\tag{3.16}\\] or equivalently (writing \\(s=c_1 t\\)) \\[\nf_I(-s) + f_R(s) = f_T\\left(-\\frac{c_2}{c_1} \\, s\\right) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ s .\n\\tag{3.17}\\] Similarly, on substituting Eq. 3.13 into condition Eq. 3.15, we find that \\[\nf_I'(-c_1 t) + f_R'(c_1 t) = f_T'(-c_2 t) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ t\n\\tag{3.18}\\] or \\[\nf_I'(-s) + f_R'(s) = f_T'\\left(-\\frac{c_2}{c_1} \\, s\\right) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ s.\n\\tag{3.19}\\] Integrating this equation in \\(s\\), we get \\[\n-f_I(-s) + f_R(s) = -\\frac{c_1}{c_2} \\, f_T\\left(-\\frac{c_2}{c_1} \\, s\\right) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ s .\n\\tag{3.20}\\] Eliminating \\(f_R(s)\\) from Eq. 3.17 and Eq. 3.20, we obtain \\[\n2f_I(-s) = \\left(1+\\frac{c_1}{c_2}\\right) \\, f_T\\left(-\\frac{c_2}{c_1} \\, s\\right) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ s .\n\\tag{3.21}\\] or, equivalently, \\[\nf_T(\\tilde{s}) = \\frac{2c_2}{c_2+c_1} \\, f_I\\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_2} \\, \\tilde{s}\\right) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ \\tilde{s}\n\\tag{3.22}\\] where \\(\\tilde{s}=-(c_2/c_1)s\\). Eq. 3.22 defines the function (of one variable) \\(f_T\\) in terms of known function \\(f_I\\).\nTo find \\(f_R\\), we substitute Eq. 3.22 into Eq. 3.17. This yields the formula \\[\nf_R(s) = \\frac{c_2-c_1}{c_2+c_1} \\, f_I\\left(- s\\right) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ s.  \n\\tag{3.23}\\] Finally, on substituting Eq. 3.22 and Eq. 3.23 into Eq. 3.13, we get the solution formula \\[\ny(x,t)=\\begin{cases}\nf_I(x-c_1 t) +  A_R f_I(-x-c_1 t), &x<0 \\\\\nA_T f_I\\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_2}(x-c_2 t)\\right), &x>0\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{3.24}\\] where \\(A_R\\) (the ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave) and \\(A_T\\) (the ratio of the amplitude of the transmitted wave to that of the incident wave) are given by \\[\n\\quad A_R=\\frac{c_2-c_1}{c_2+c_1}, \\quad\nA_T=\\frac{2c_2}{c_2+c_1}.\n\\tag{3.25}\\]\nTo check whether our answer makes sense, it is useful to consider a few limit cases.\n\nIf \\(\\rho_1=\\rho_2\\), then \\(c_1=c_2\\), and we have \\(A_R=0\\) and \\(A_T=1\\) (as one would expect for an infinite homogeneous string).\nIf \\(\\rho_1\\ll\\rho_2\\) (the first string is much lighter than the second one), then \\(c_1\\gg c_2\\), and we have \\(A_R\\approx -1\\) and \\(A_T=0\\) (so that the heavy string effectively arrests the displacement at \\(x=0\\) as if the right end of the first string was fixed).\nIf \\(\\rho_1\\gg\\rho_2\\) (the first string is much heavier than the second one), then \\(c_1\\ll c_2\\), and we have \\(A_R\\approx 1\\) and \\(A_T=2\\) (so that the light second string does not effect the displacement at \\(x=0\\) as if the right end of the first string was free).\n\n\n\n\n\nBaldock, G.

    "text": "4.3 Standing waves and superposition\nThe solutions we obtained in the previous section are standing waves. They don’t change their shape and don’t move, only their amplitude oscillates with time. In the lecture videos I make various sketches and animations to illustrate this.\nSo we now have a stark contrast between what d’Alembert found and what Bernoulli found. According to d’Alembert, the solutions of the wave equation are travelling waves of arbitrary shape. According to Bernoulli, the solutions are standing waves that have sine shape. It is always wonderful when one has two very different ways of looking at the same phenomenon. That is where deep understanding comes from.\nTo resolve the apparent conflict between d’Alembert’s solution and Bernoulli’s solution we have to use the superposition principle: For any set of linear homogeneous equations, any sum of solutions is also a solution.\nSince the wave equation is linear and also the boundary conditions we imposed were linear, a linear combination of any number of harmonic standing waves is also a solution. So, we can construct a general solution of the wave equation by summing up all 1 the harmonic standing waves from Eq. 4.11: \\[\ny(x,t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\sin\\left(k x\\right)\\left(F_k \\, \\sin(k c t) + G_k \\, \\cos(k c t)\\right).\n\\tag{4.12}\\] Here the \\(G_k\\) and the \\(F_k\\) are undetermined constants, to be fixed from the initial conditions.1 We do not need negative \\(k\\) because they will produce the same solutions, and we do not need \\(k=0\\) because it yields zero solution. Also, we have absorbed the constant \\(A\\) into the constants \\(F_k\\) and \\(G_k\\).\nThe resolution of the apparent paradox is that a superposition of standing waves can give a travelling wave, and that a superposition of sine waves can give any shape."

The idea behind this method is to assume that the solution of a partial differential equation can be expressed as a product of two functions, one depending only on the spatial variables and the other only on the temporal variables. This reduces the partial differential equation to a set of ordinary differential equations, which can be solved independently.

The wave speed is now dependent on the wave number \\(k\\): \\[\nc(k)=\\sqrt{c^2  - p^2/(4k^2)}.\n\\tag{5.15}\\] If we want to, we can get a real solution by taking the real part of the complex solution: \\[\n\\operatorname{Re}(y(x,t))=a\\, e^{-pt/2} \\cos\\left[k\\left(x \\pm t \\, \\sqrt{c^2  - p^2/(4k^2)}\\right)+\\phi\\right]\n\\tag{5.16}\\] where \\(a=\\vert A\\vert\\) and \\(\\phi=\\arg(A)\\).\n\nNote that the imaginary part of \\(\\omega\\) produces the damping exponential and the real part of \\(\\omega\\) determines the wave speed.\n\n\n\n\nBaldock, G.

The work done to change the length from \\(\\delta x\\) to \\(\\delta s\\) is \\(T(\\delta s - \\delta x)\\). This gives the potential energy (we neglect the potential energy coming from gravity).

This phenomenon is referred to as “equipartition” of the energy. Together we have \\[\n\\mathcal{E}(x,t)=T\\,(f'(x-ct))^2.\n\\tag{6.9}\\] Note how the energy density is travelling along with the wave profile.\n\n\nExample 6.2 (Standing harmonic wave) Now we consider solutions of the form \\[\\begin{split}\ny(x,t)&=\\sin(kx)(F\\sin(kct)+G\\cos(kct))\\\\\n&=\\alpha\\cos(kct+\\phi).\n\\end{split} \\tag{6.10}\\] We calculate the energy densities \\[\\begin{split}\n\\mathcal{E}_K&=\\frac{\\rho}{2}(\\partial_t y(x,t))^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{\\rho}{2}\\alpha^2 k^2 c^2(-\\sin(kct+\\phi))^2\\sin^2(kx)\n\\end{split} \\tag{6.11}\\] and \\[\\begin{split}\n\\mathcal{E}_V&=\\frac{T}{2}(\\partial_x y(x,t))^2\\\\\n&=\\frac{T}{2}\\alpha^2 k^2 (\\cos(kct+\\phi))^2\\cos^2(kx)\n\\end{split} \\tag{6.12}\\] Again we notice that the prefactors are the same because \\(c^2\\rho=T\\).

A similar calculation shows that also the potential energy of the sum is the sum of the potential energies and so this is also true of the total energy: \\[\nE[y_k+y_l]=E[y_k]+E[y_l].\n\\tag{6.18}\\] This is one of the nice properties of harmonic waves.\n\n\nExample 6.4 (Complex exponential wave) We calculate the energy density of the complex solution \\[\ny(x,t)=A\\,e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}.\n\\tag{6.19}\\] The expression for the energy density of complex solutions involves the absolute value squared: \\[\n\\mathcal{E}[y]=\\frac{\\rho}{2}|\\partial_t y|^2+\\frac{T}{2}|\\partial_x y|^2.\n\\tag{6.20}\\] This has the effect that the energy density is the sum of the energy density of the real part of the solution and the energy density of the imaginary part of the solution. We find \\[\\begin{split}\n\\mathcal{E}[A\\,e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}]&=\\frac{\\rho}{2}\\left|-i\\omega \\,A\\,e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}\\right|^2+\\frac{T}{2}\\left|ik \\,A\\,e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}\\right|^2\\\\\n&=\\left(\\frac{\\rho}{2}\\omega^2+\\frac{T}{2}k^2\\right)|A|^2\n\\end{split} \\tag{6.21}\\] So another miracle of these complex exponential solutions is that their energy density is constant."

Similarly the flux at the right boundary is zero: \\[\n\\mathcal{F}(\\pi,t)=-T\\,\\partial_ty(\\pi,t)\\,\\partial_xy(\\pi,t)=0.\n\\tag{6.28}\\] So by the conservation equation it follows that the energy is conserved.\n\n\n\n\nBaldock, G.

In the equilibrium state, it is flat and coincides with the \\((x,y)\\) plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). We assume that it is stretched to a tension \\(T\\) (force per unit length, measured in \\(N/m\\)). This means that for any line on the surface of the membrane, the part of the membrane on one side of the line exerts a force \\(T\\) (per unit length of the line) on the other part of the membrane (on the other side of the line), and the direction of the force is perpendicular to the line.\nThe perturbed membrane may be described as a time-dependent surface \\(z=z(x,y,t)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), where \\(z(x,y,t)\\) is the vertical (in the \\(z\\) direction) displacement of the membrane at point \\((x,y)\\) and time \\(t\\). To derive the equation of motion, we consider a small element of the membrane of size \\(\\delta x\\) and \\(\\delta y\\) in \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), as shown in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: A membrane stretched in the \\(x\\)–\\(y\\) plane and vibrating in the \\(z\\) direction.\n\n\nWe assume that there is only transverse motion of the membrane and that the partial derivatives \\(\\partial_x z\\) and \\(\\partial_y z\\) are small: \\(\\vert\\partial_x z\\vert \\ll 1\\) and \\(\\vert\\partial_y z\\vert \\ll 1\\). Almost the same arguments as those in Section 1.2 lead to the conclusion that the vertical component of the force is a sum of two terms: \\(T \\delta y \\, \\partial_x^2 z \\, \\delta x\\) (coming from the tension forces that are nearly parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis in Figure 7.1) and \\(T \\delta x \\, \\partial_y^2 z \\, \\delta y\\) (coming from the tension forces that are nearly parallel to the \\(y\\)-axis in Figure 7.1). So, Newton’s equation of motion (\\(ma=F\\)) yields \\[\n(\\rho \\, \\delta x \\, \\delta y)\\partial_t^2 z = T \\delta y \\, \\partial_x^2 z \\, \\delta x + T \\delta x \\, \\partial_y^2 z \\, \\delta y.\n\\tag{7.1}\\] Dividing this by \\(\\delta x \\, \\delta y\\) and \\(\\rho\\), we get the governing equation for the membrane: \\[\n\\partial_t^2 z = \\frac{T}{\\rho} \\left( \\partial_x^2 \\, z  +  \\partial_y^2 \\, z\\right)\n\\tag{7.2}\\] or, equivalently, \\[\n\\partial_t^2 z  - c^2 \\nabla^2 z = 0, \\quad c=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\rho}}.\n\\tag{7.3}\\] Here \\(c\\) in the wave speed and \\(\\nabla^2\\) is the Laplace operator: \\[\n\\nabla^2= \\partial_x^2  + \\partial_y^2.\n\\tag{7.4}\\] Sometimes, the Laplace operator is also denoted by \\(\\Delta\\) (i.e. \\(\\Delta = \\nabla^2 = \\partial_x^2 + \\partial_y^2\\)). Eq. 7.3 is the two-dimensional wave equation. Written in terms of the Laplace operator it easily generalises to any higher dimension."

    "text": "You find content related to this lecture in the textbooks:\n\nBaldock and Bridgeman (1983) section 7.4\nCoulson and Jeffrey (1977) section 33\n\n\n\nConsider a rectangular membrane: \\(D=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\vert 0<x<a, \\ 0<y<b \\}\\). Let’s solve the wave equation \\[\n\\partial_t^2 \\, z -c^2 \\, \\left(\\partial_x^2 \\, z + \\partial_y^2 \\, z\\right)=0 \\quad \\text{in} \\ \\ D\n\\tag{8.1}\\] subject to the fixed (Dirichlet) boundary condition \\[\nz(x,y,t)=0 \\quad \\text{on} \\ \\ \\partial D\n\\tag{8.2}\\] or, equivalently, \\[\nz(0,y,t)=0, \\quad z(a,y,t)=0\n\\tag{8.3}\\] and \\[\nz(x,0,t)=0, \\quad z(x,b,t)=0.\n\\tag{8.4}\\] To find a solution, we use the method of separation of variables (see Section 4.1), i.e., we make the Ansatz \\[\nz(x,y,t)=X(x)Y(y)T(t).\n\\tag{8.5}\\] Substituting this Ansatz into the wave equation, we get \\[\nXYT''=c^2\\left(X''YT + XY''T\\right),\n\\tag{8.6}\\] which, after dividing by \\(XYT\\) gives \\[\n\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2\\left(\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\n+\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}\\right).\n\\tag{8.7}\\] In the last equation, we have a function of one variable, \\(t\\), on the left side and a function of two different variables, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), on the right side. The equation can be satisfied for all \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(t\\) only if both sides are equal to a constant. As in Section 4.1, we choose this constant to be negative and (for convenience) equal to \\(-k^2 c^2\\) (for arbitrary real \\(k\\)). Again, the possibility of a positive constant is excluded, because with a positive constant it is impossible to find solutions satisfying the boundary conditions. Thus, we have \\[\n\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2\\left(\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\n+\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}\\right)= -k^2 c^2.\n\\tag{8.8}\\] This leads to the ODE \\[\nT''(t)=-c^2 k^2  \\, T(t)\n\\tag{8.9}\\] and to the equation \\[\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}\n+\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}= -k^2.\n\\tag{8.10}\\] The general solution of Eq. 8.9 is \\[\nT(t)=F \\, \\sin(k c t) +G \\, \\cos(k c t),\n\\tag{8.11}\\] where \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are arbitrary constants.\nRewriting Eq. 8.10 as \\[\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}= -k^2 -\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)},\n\\tag{8.12}\\] we conclude that for this equation to hold for all \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), both sides must be equal to a constant, which we choose to write as \\(-\\nu^2\\) (for some real \\(\\nu\\)). Also, introducing the constant \\(\\mu\\) so that \\(\\nu^2+\\mu^2=k^2\\) gives us the equations \\[\nX''(x) =-\\nu^2 X(x), \\quad Y''(y)=-\\mu^2Y(y).\n\\tag{8.13}\\]\nThe general solutions are \\[\\begin{split}\nX(x)&=A\\sin(\\nu x)+ B\\cos(\\nu x),\\\\\nY(y)&=C\\sin(\\mu y)+ D\\cos(\\mu y),\n\\end{split} \\tag{8.14}\\] for arbitrary constants \\(A,B,C,D\\).\nNow we are ready to impose the boundary conditions.\nThe condition \\(z(0,y,t)=0\\) for all \\(y,t\\) requires that \\(X(0)=0\\) and, because \\(X(0)= B\\), this implies that \\(B=0\\). Similarly the condition \\(z(a,y,t)=0\\) requires that \\(X(a)=0\\) and because \\(X(a)=A\\sin(\\nu\\, a)\\) (because we already know that \\(B=0\\)), this implies that either \\(A=0\\), which is not an interesting case because it makes the entire solution vanish, or that \\(\\nu=n\\pi/a\\) with \\(n\\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). Without loss of generality we can take \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) because negative \\(n\\) just give the same solution up to a sign that can be absorbed into the arbitrary constant \\(A\\), and \\(n=0\\) gives the zero solution.\nThe conditions \\(z(x,0,t)=0=z(x,b,t)\\) similarly require that \\(Y(0)=0=Y(\\pi)\\) and thus \\(D=0\\) and \\(\\mu=m\\pi/a\\) with \\(m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\).\nThus we have found the following solutions satisfying the boundary conditions: \\[\\begin{split}\nz_{nm}(x,y,t)=&\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{a}nx\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{b}my\\right)\\\\\n&\\cdot\\left(F_{nm}\\sin(k_{nm}ct)+G_{nm}\\cos(k_{nm}ct)\\right)\n\\end{split} \\tag{8.15}\\] with \\[\nk_{nm}=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{a}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{b}\\right)^2}\n\\tag{8.16}\\] for any choice of \\(n,m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(F_{nm},G_{nm}\\in\\mathbb{R}\\).\nNote that solutions Eq. 8.15 already satisfy the boundary conditions Eq. 8.3 and Eq. 8.4. Such solutions are called normal modes of the membrane. Snapshots of normal modes with \\((n,m)=(1,1)\\), \\((n,m)=(1,2)\\), \\((n,m)=(2,2)\\) and \\((n,m)=(3,2)\\) are shown in Figure 8.1.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: Some normal modes of a rectangular membrane\n\n\nThe amplitudes of the normal modes oscillate over time. The following video shows an animation of various normal modes:\n\nAny solution of the wave equation Eq. 8.1 satisfying the boundary conditions Eq. 8.3 and Eq. 8.4 can be presented as a linear combination of normal modes Eq. 8.15:\n\\[\nz(x,y,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\\sum_{m=1}^\\infty z_{nm}.\n\\tag{8.17}\\] The free constants \\(F_{nm}\\) and \\(G_{nm}\\) are then determined by the initial conditions, using the Fourier transform technique as in the one-dimensional case.\nTo construct a solution satisfying the initial conditions \\[\nz(x,y,0)=z_0(x,y), \\quad \\partial_t z(x,y,0)=v_0(x,y)\n\\tag{8.18}\\] we evaluate our general solution and its \\(t\\) derivative at the boundary. This gives \\[\nz(x,y,0)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}\n\\sin\\frac{\\pi n x}{a} \\, \\sin\\frac{\\pi m y}{b} G_{nm}= z_0(x,y),\n\\tag{8.19}\\] \\[\n\\partial_t z(x,y,0)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} k_{nm} c \\,\nB_{nm} \\, \\sin\\frac{\\pi n x}{a} \\, \\sin\\frac{\\pi m y}{b}=v_0(x,y).\n\\tag{8.20}\\] Comparing these with the (double) Fourier series for functions \\(z_0(x,y)\\) and \\(v_0(x,y)\\), one can deduce that \\[\\begin{split}\nG_{nm} &= \\frac{4}{ab} \\, \\int\\limits_{0}^{a} dx \\int\\limits_{0}^{b}  dy \\,  z_0(x,y)\n\\sin\\frac{\\pi n x}{a} \\, \\sin\\frac{\\pi m y}{b},  \\\\\nF_{nm} &= \\frac{1}{k_{nm}c} \\, \\frac{4}{ab} \\, \\int\\limits_{0}^{a} dx \\int\\limits_{0}^{b}  dy \\, v_0(x,y)\n\\sin\\frac{\\pi n x}{a} \\, \\sin\\frac{\\pi m y}{b}.  \n\\end{split} \\tag{8.21}\\]\n\n\n\n\nBaldock, G.

    "text": "You find content related to this lecture in the textbooks:\n\nBaldock and Bridgeman (1983) section 7.5\nCoulson and Jeffrey (1977) sections 7 (eqs.(31) - (35)) and section 35\n\n\nThe following video has some mistakes in it. These are corrected in these notes.\n\n\n\nLet’s find normal mode solution for a circular membrane of radius \\(a\\) with fixed boundary (see Figure 9.1). Mathematically, we need to solve the wave equation (Eq. 8.1) in the disc of radius \\(a\\), i.e. in region \\(D=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\vert r^2=x^2+y^2 < a^2 \\}\\). It is convenient to use polar coordinates \\((r,\\theta)\\), defined as (see Figure 9.1) \\[\nx=r\\cos\\theta, \\quad y=r\\sin\\theta.\n\\tag{9.1}\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Circular membrane with radius \\(a\\) and polar coordinates.\n\n\nLet \\[\nZ(r, \\theta, t) = z\\left(x(r,\\theta), y(r, \\theta),t\\right),\n\\tag{9.2}\\] i.e., \\(Z(r, \\theta, t)\\) is a solution of the wave equation in \\(D\\), expressed in terms of polar coordinates.\nWe know that the wave equation can be written in vector notation using the Laplace operator \\(\\nabla^2\\) as \\[\n\\partial_t^2 z - c^2 \\nabla^2 z =0.\n\\tag{9.3}\\] It is well-known (see, e.g., Theorem 3.43 in the Spring 2020 Calculus notes or Theorem 4.6 in the Spring 2021 Calculus notes) that the Laplacian in polar coordinates is given by \\[\n\\nabla^2 = \\partial_r^2 + \\frac{1}{r}\\, \\partial_r + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\, \\partial_{\\theta}^2.\n\\tag{9.4}\\] Therefore, the 2D wave equation in polar coordinates has the form \\[\n\\partial_t^2 Z - c^2\n\\left(\\partial_r^2 Z + \\frac{1}{r}\\, \\partial_r Z + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\, \\partial_{\\theta}^2 Z\\right)= 0.\n\\tag{9.5}\\] Our aim is to solve it subject to the boundary condition Eq. 9.20. As in the preceding section, we employ the method of separation of variables, i.e. we assume that \\[\nZ(r, \\theta, t)=R(r)\\Theta(\\theta)T(t).\n\\tag{9.6}\\] Substituting this into Eq. 9.5, we find that \\[\nR\\Theta T''=c^2\\left(R''\\Theta T + \\frac{1}{r} \\, R'\\Theta T + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\, R\\Theta'' T\\right)\n\\tag{9.7}\\] Dividing by \\(R\\Theta T\\) gives \\[\n\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2\\left(\\frac{R''(r)}{R(r)} + \\frac{R'(r)}{r R(r)}+\\frac{\\Theta''(\\theta)}{r^2\\Theta(\\theta)}\\right).\n\\tag{9.8}\\] Employing the same arguments as in the preceding section, we conclude that \\[\n\\frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = c^2\\left(\\frac{R''(r)}{R(r)} + \\frac{R'(r)}{r R(r)}+\n\\frac{\\Theta''(\\theta)}{r^2\\Theta(\\theta)}\\right)\n= -k^2 c^2\n\\tag{9.9}\\] for some constant \\(k\\). This means that we have the ODE \\[\nT''(t)=-k^2 c^2 \\, T(t)\n\\tag{9.10}\\] and the equation \\[\n\\frac{R''(r)}{R(r)} + \\frac{R'(r)}{r R(r)}+\n\\frac{\\Theta''(\\theta)}{r^2\\Theta(\\theta)} = -k^2\n\\tag{9.11}\\] The general solution of Eq. 8.3 is (cf. Eq. 8.11) \\[\nT(t)=F \\, \\sin(k c t)+G \\, \\cos(k c t)\n\\tag{9.12}\\] where \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) are arbitrary constants.\nRewriting Eq. 9.12 as \\[\n\\frac{r^2R''(r)+rR'(r)}{R(r)} + k^2 r^2 = -\\frac{\\Theta''(\\theta)}{\\Theta(\\theta)},\n\\tag{9.13}\\] we conclude that for this equation to hold for all \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\), both sides must be equal to a constant, which we choose to be \\(n^2\\) (for some constant \\(n\\)), i.e. \\[\nr^2\\left(\\frac{R''(r)}{R(r)} + \\frac{R'(r)}{r R(r)} \\right)+ k^2 r^2 = n^2, \\quad\n-\\frac{\\Theta''(\\theta)}{\\Theta(\\theta)}= n^2\n\\tag{9.14}\\] (the constant, \\(n^2\\), cannot be negative because, with a negative constant, it will be impossible to obtain a solution). Thus, we we have obtained the following two ODEs: \\[\nR''(r) + \\frac{1}{r} \\, R'(r) +\\left(k^2 -\\frac{\\lambda^2}{r^2}\\right) R(r) = 0\n\\tag{9.15}\\] and \\[\n\\Theta''(\\theta)=-n^2 \\Theta(\\theta) .\n\\tag{9.16}\\]\nThe general solution of Eq. 9.16 is \\[\n\\Theta(\\theta) = A\\sin(n \\theta)+B\\cos(n \\theta)\n\\tag{9.17}\\] for arbitrary constants \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). We impose the periodicity condition \\[\n\\Theta(\\theta+2\\pi) = \\Theta(\\theta) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ \\ \\theta.\n\\] This is a natural condition because \\((r,\\theta)\\) and \\((r,\\theta+2\\pi)\\) represent a single point in domain \\(D\\). Thus we require \\(n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\). In fact we only need to consider \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{ 0\\}\\) because of the symmetry of \\(\\sin\\) and \\(\\cos\\).\nEq. 9.15 has the form \\[\nr^2\\,R''(r) + r \\, R'(r) +\\left(r^2\\,k^2 -n^2\\right) R(r) = 0.\n\\tag{9.18}\\] It is a well-known equation, called the Bessel differential equation. Its solutions are not elementary functions. We are only interested in solutions that are finite at \\(r=0\\). There is a whole family of such solutions, \\[\nR(r) =J_n(kr),\n\\tag{9.19}\\] where \\(J_n\\) is the \\(n\\)th Bessel functions of the first type. We have already determined above that we are only interested in the cases where \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{0\\}\\).\nNext we need to impose the zero Dirichlet boundary condition (the edge of the membrane is fixed) \\[\nZ(a, \\theta, t) =  0.\n\\tag{9.20}\\] To do this, we only need to know that each Bessel function has an infinite number of zeros. A plot of the first few Bessel functions of the 1st kind is shown in Figure 9.2.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Plot of the first four Bessel functions of the 1st kind.\n\n\nWe denote the \\(m\\)th zero of the \\(n\\)th Bessel function of the 1st kind by \\(k_{nm}\\). We have \\[\\begin{split}\nR(a)=0 \\quad &\\Rightarrow \\quad J_n(k\\,a)=0\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\quad k\\,a=k_{nm}\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\quad k=\\frac{k_{nm}}{a}\n\\end{split}\\] for \\(m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\).\nFinally, combining the above with Eq. 9.12 and Eq. 9.17, we obtain the following solutions (that satisfy the required boundary condition): \\[\\begin{split}\nZ_{nm}(r,\\theta,t)=&J_m\\left(k_{nm} \\frac{r}{a}\\right)\\\\\n\\cdot&\\Big[  \\sin(n\\theta)\n\\left(F_{nm} \\, \\sin(k_{nm} c t) + G_{nm} \\, \\cos(k_{nm} c t)\\right)\\\\\n&+\\cos(n\\theta)\n\\left(\\tilde{F}_{nm} \\, \\sin(k_{nm} c t) + \\tilde{G}_{nm} \\, \\cos(k_{nm} c t)\\right)\\Big]\n\\end{split} \\tag{9.21}\\] where \\(n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\cup\\{0\\}\\), \\(m\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(F_{nm}\\), \\(G_{nm}\\), \\(\\tilde{F}_{nm}\\) and \\(\\tilde{G}_{nm}\\) are arbitrary real constants. Solutions in the form Eq. 9.21 are the normal modes of vibrations of the circular membrane. Once normal modes are known, we can find a solution satisfying some initial conditions by using a linear combination of the normal modes \\[\nZ(r,\\theta,t)=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty}Z_{nm}(r,\\theta,t).\n\\tag{9.22}\\] Note that constants \\(F_{nm}\\), \\(G_{nm}\\), \\(\\tilde{F}_{nm}\\) and \\(\\tilde{G}_{nm}\\) (in the formula for \\(Z_{nm}\\) for each \\(n,m\\)) are still arbitrary. To determine them, we need to substitute Eq. 9.22 into initial conditions. This will lead to the so-called Fourier-Bessel series. This is based on the identities \\[\n\\int_0^aJ_n\\left(k_{nm}\\frac{r}{a}\\right)J_n\\left(k_{nl}\\frac{r}{a}\\right)r\\,dr\n=\\delta_{ml}\\frac{a^2}{2}\\left(J_{n+1}(k_{nm})\\right)^2.\n\\tag{9.23}\\]\n\n\n\n\nBaldock, G.

    "text": "10.1 Fluid flow\n\n\nFluids are considered as continuous media. Because any small volume element of a fluid contains a huge number of molecules, instead of describing the location and velocity of all the individual molecules, we work with quantities which should be thought of as averages over very small neighbourhoods.\nSo we describe the distribution of matter via a smooth density function \\(\\rho(x,y,z,t)\\) (mass/volume) and its motion via a smooth velocity field \\(\\underline{u}(x,y,z,t)\\).\nThe fluid velocity is a vector field, which means that it is a vector whose direction and magnitude may be different at different points in space: \\[\\begin{split}\n\\underline{u}(x,y,z,t) &=(u_x(x,y,z,t),u_y(x,y,z,t),u_z(x,y,z,t))\\\\\n&= u_x(x,y,z,t) \\underline{e}_x + u_y(x,y,z,t) \\underline{e}_y +\nu_z(x,y,z,t) \\underline{e}_z .\n\\end{split} \\tag{10.1}\\] We will also use the shorthand \\(\\underline{u}(\\underline{x},t)\\) where \\(\\underline{x}=(x,y,z)\\) is the position vector.\nWe will sometimes be looking at particular simple kinds of flows:\n\nDefinition 10.1 A steady flow is a flow whose velocity field at every point is independent of time: \\[\n\\partial_t\\underline{u} =0,~~ \\text{ i.e., }~~ \\underline{u}(\\underline{x},t)=\\underline{u}(\\underline{x}).\n\\]\n\n\nDefinition 10.2 A two-dimensional (2D) flow is a flow whose velocity field is independent of the third coordinate (which we will always choose to be the \\(z\\) coordinate) and has no component in that third direction: \\[\n\\partial_z\\underline{u} =0 \\text{ and }u_z=0,\n\\] i.e., \\[\n\\underline{u}(\\underline{x},t)=u_x(x,y,t)\\underline{e}_x + u_y(x,y,t)\\underline{e}_y=(u_x(x,y,t),u_y(x,y,t),0).\n\\]\n\nA vector field can be visualised by drawing vectors attached to different points in space.

Then it must satisfy the following vector ODE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPathline equation\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\underline{x}(t)}{dt}=\\underline{u}(\\underline{x}(t),t).\n\\tag{10.2}\\]\n\n\nEquivalently, we can write this vector ODE as a system of three scalar ODEs: \\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}&=u_x(x(t),y(t),z(t),t),\\\\\n\\frac{dy(t)}{dt}&=u_y(x(t),y(t),z(t),t),\\\\\n\\frac{dz(t)}{dt}&=u_z(x(t),y(t),z(t),t).\n\\end{split} \\tag{10.3}\\]\n\nExample 10.1 Find the pathlines for the 2D flow \\(\\underline{u}=(-y,x,0)\\).\n\n\nSolution. We solve the ODEs \\[\n\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=-y(t), \\quad \\frac{dy(t)}{dt}=x(t), \\quad \\frac{dz(t)}{dt}=0.\n\\tag{10.4}\\] The general solution of this system is \\[\\\nx(t)=A\\sin t + B\\cos  t, ~~~\ny(t)=- A\\cos  t +B\\sin t,~~~z(t)=C\n\\tag{10.5}\\] for some constants \\(A,B,C\\). If we have initial conditions \\(x(0)=x_0\\), \\(y(0)=y_0\\) and \\(z(0)=z_0\\), we find that \\(B=x_0\\), \\(A=y_0\\) and \\(C=z_0\\).

In the video lecture we sketch this velocity field at \\(t=0\\) and \\(t=1\\).\nTo find the pathlines we solve the ODEs \\[\n\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=x(t), \\quad \\frac{dy(t)}{dt}=t, \\quad \\frac{dz(t)}{dt}=0.\n\\tag{10.7}\\] The solution of this system with initial values \\(\\underline{x}(0)=(x_0,y_0,z_0)\\) is \\[\nx(t)=x_0e^t, ~~~\ny(t)=\\frac12 t^2 y_0,~~~z(t)=z_0.\n\\tag{10.8}\\]\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Streamlines\nA streamline of a flow is a curve such that, at each point of the curve, the tangent line to it is parallel to the velocity at the same point. If the velocity field depends on time, then streamlines may be different at different moments of time. Let \\(\\underline{u}(\\underline{x},t)\\) be a velocity field. It follows from this definition that if \\(\\underline{x}(s)=(x(s),y(s),z(s))\\) is a parametrisation of a streamline (with some parameter \\(s\\) along the streamline), then the tangent vector to the curve, \\(d\\underline{x}(s)/ds\\), must be parallel to \\(\\underline{u}(\\underline{x}(s),t)\\). This means \\[\n\\frac{d\\underline{x}(s)}{ds}=\\lambda \\, \\underline{u}(\\underline{x}(s),t)\n\\tag{10.9}\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is a nonzero scalar which may depend on both \\(\\underline{x}\\) and \\(t\\). Clearly, there is a freedom in choosing \\(\\lambda\\). The simplest choice that we shall use from now on is \\(\\lambda=1\\). So, the streamlines are solutions of the following vector ODE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreamline equation\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d\\underline{x}(s)}{ds}=\\underline{u}(\\underline{x}(s),t)\n\\tag{10.10}\\]\n\n\nIn components this equation becomes \\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dx(s)}{ds}&=u_x(x(s),y(s),z(s),t),\\\\\n\\frac{dy(s)}{ds}&=u_y(x(s),y(s),z(s),t),\\\\\n\\frac{dz(s)}{ds}&=u_z(x(s),y(s),z(s),t).\n\\end{split} \\tag{10.11}\\]\nSo in Example 10.2 the ODEs for the streamlines are \\[\n\\frac{dx(s)}{ds}=x(s), \\quad \\frac{dy(s)}{ds}=t, \\quad \\frac{dz(s)}{ds}=0.\n\\tag{10.12}\\] The solution of this system for the streamline starting at \\(\\underline{x}(0)=(x_0,y_0,z_0)\\) is \\[\nx(s)=x_0e^s, ~~~\ny(t)=\\frac12 st+ y_0,~~~z(t)=z_0.\n\\tag{10.13}\\] Note that this is different from the pathlines that we determined for Example 10.2\nFor steady flows (\\(\\underline{u}=\\underline{u}(\\underline{x})\\)) streamlines coincide with pathlines, because Eq. 10.11 will be exactly the same as Eq. 10.3, with \\(s=t\\). But in general pathlines and streamlines represent different quantities and should not be confused with each other. To summarise:\nPathlines are the paths traced out by individual fluid particles as they move through a flow field over a period of time. In other words, a pathline is the trajectory followed by a single fluid particle in the flow field, and it can be used to visualize the history of the particle’s motion. Pathlines can be curved, twisted, or convoluted, and they can cross and intersect with each other.\nStreamlines, on the other hand, are imaginary lines that are everywhere tangent to the velocity vector of the flow at a given instant in time. In other words, they represent the instantaneous direction of fluid motion at every point in the flow field. Streamlines do not represent the paths of individual fluid particles, but rather they represent the direction of the flow at any given instant. Streamlines are useful to visualize the flow pattern of a fluid."

    "section": "11.1 The Euler equations for an ideal fluid",
    "text": "11.1 The Euler equations for an ideal fluid\n\n\nEuler wrote down the partial differential equations describing an ideal fluid already in 1755. This was one of the first partial differential equations systems to be studied.\nAn ideal fluid has two simplifying properties:\n\nConstant density: The density is constant throughout the fluid at all times, so the density that in a general fluid could be a function of space and time is a constant: \\(\\rho(\\underline{x},t)=\\rho\\), i.e., \\[\n\\partial_t\\rho=0=\\underline{\\nabla}\\rho.\n\\tag{11.1}\\] This implies that also the material derivative is zero: \\[\n\\frac{D\\rho}{Dt}=\\partial_t\\rho+\\underline{u}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla}\\rho=0.\n\\tag{11.2}\\] We had seen already that this implies that the fluid is incompressible: \\(\\underline{\\nabla}\\cdot\\underline{u}=0\\). But the condition on an ideal fluid is stronger than incompressibility, because it demands that the density is not only constant as experienced by each fluid particle, but that it is also the same across different fluid particles.\nNo viscosity: The force that the fluid exerts on any infinitesimal surface element is solely in the direction of the normal vector to the surface element. Thus this surface force contribution can be written as \\[\nd\\underline{F}^{(s)}=p\\, \\underline{n}\\, dS\n\\tag{11.3}\\] where \\(p=p(\\underline{x},t)\\) is called the pressure, \\(\\underline{n}\\) is the normal vector to the surface, and the factor of \\(dS\\) expresses that the force is proportional to the area of the surface element.\nThus in an ideal fluid there are no surface forces acting tangentially to the surface, also called shear forces. Such a fluid is also called inviscid. The opposite would be a viscous fluid. In reality every fluid has at least a little bit of viscosity, but in circumstances where these viscous forces are negligible compared to the other forces we can neglect them and treat the fluid as inviscid.\n\nThere are phenomena that we will not be able to model correctly when we neglect viscosity. For example, when we will study the flow of air over an aerofoil, a thin layer of fluid near the surface experiences a high level of shear stress due to the no-slip condition at the surface. This results in the formation of a boundary layer, which is a region of fluid where the velocity gradients are large and the viscosity of the fluid plays a critical role in determining the behaviour of the flow. Luckily the details of the flow in this boundary layer does not affect the lift force that we want to calculate.\nAnother phenomenon we can not describe with inviscid flows is turbulence. Turbulent flows arise for example at the rear of real-world aerofoils when the boundary layer detaches from the aerofoil. There the viscosity of the fluid plays a critical role in dissipating the kinetic energy of the turbulent motion into heat and this produces the drag on the airplane. But again this does not affect the lift force, just the drag force.\nThe equation of motion for the fluid is simply derived from Newton’s equation \\(m\\mathbf{a}=\\underline{F}\\). We consider a small volume \\(V\\) inside the fluid. We sum up the mass multiplied by the acceleration for each fluid particle inside the volume, which due to our continuity approximation becomes an integral of the density multiplied by the acceleration vector field \\(D\\underline{u}/Dt\\) over the volume \\(V\\): \\[\nm\\underline{a} = \\int\\limits_{V} \\rho \\, \\frac{D\\underline{u}}{Dt} \\, dV .\n\\tag{11.4}\\]\nAs discussed above, for an ideal fluid the only force acting on the surface of the volume \\(V\\) is the force due to the pressure in the surrounding fluid. The total force exerted on the volume \\(V\\) is obtained by integrating the contributions from all infinitesimal surface elements: \\[\n\\underline{F}^{(s)} = -\\oint\\limits_{\\partial V} p \\, \\underline{n} \\, dS .\n%\\quad \\text{or, in components,} \\quad  \\underline{F} = -\\oint\\limits_{\\partial V} p \\, n_i \\, dV \\ \\ \\text{for} \\ \\ i=1,2,3.\n\\tag{11.5}\\] The reason for the minus sign is that by convention \\(\\underline{n}\\) denotes the outwards normal, but we are interested in the force acting on the volume from the outside.\nWe now use a form of the divergence theorem that you may not have met yet:\n\nTheorem 11.1 For any scalar function \\(f(\\underline{x})\\) \\[\n\\oint\\limits_{\\partial V} f \\, \\underline{n} \\, dS = \\int\\limits_{V} \\underline{\\nabla} f \\, dV.\n\\tag{11.6}\\]\n\n\nProof. The \\(i\\)th component of the above vector equation can be obtained by setting \\(\\underline{F}=f\\underline{e}_i\\) in the divergence theorem Theorem 10.1.\n\nApplying this to the expression for the surface force \\(\\underline{F}^{(s)}\\) by setting \\(f=p\\) allows us to express the force as a volume integral: \\[\n\\underline{F}^{(s)} = -\\int\\limits_{V} \\underline{\\nabla} p\\, dV.\n\\tag{11.7}\\]\nWe added the superscript \\((s)\\) to the pressure force to indicate that this is a force acting on a surface – a so-called surface force. An ideal fluid can also be subject to other forces, called body forces, that act at every point in the fluid, like the gravitational force or possibly electromagnetic forces. We will here consider the gravitational force. We obtain the gravitational force acting on our volume \\(V\\) by summing the gravitational force (mass times gravitational acceleration \\(\\underline{g}\\)) on all particles, which in our continuum approximation becomes an integral: \\[\n\\underline{F}^{(g)}=\\int_V\\rho\\,\\underline{g}\\,dV.\n\\tag{11.8}\\]\nSo, Newton’s equation \\(m\\underline{a}=\\underline{F}\\) applied to our volume V of fluid takes the form \\[\n\\int\\limits_{V} \\rho \\, \\frac{D\\underline{u}}{Dt} \\, dV = -\\int\\limits_{V} \\underline{\\nabla} p\\, dV + \\int_V\\rho\\,\\underline{g}\\,dV.\n\\tag{11.9}\\] This must hold for any volume \\(V\\). Therefore, we conclude that \\[\n\\rho \\, \\frac{D\\underline{u}}{Dt} = -\\underline{\\nabla} p + \\rho\\,\\underline{g}.\n\\tag{11.10}\\] This equation, together with the incompressibility condition Eq. 10.30 are called Euler’s equations for an ideal fluid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEuler’s equations for an ideal fluid\n\n\n\n\\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{D\\underline{u}}{Dt} &= -\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\underline{\\nabla} p + \\underline{g}\\\\\n\\underline{\\nabla}\\cdot\\underline{u} &= 0\n\\end{split} \\tag{11.11}\\]"

We have seen that this is a circular flow. This describes for example the flow in a rotating bucket of water. 11 The reason why the water in a rotating bucket rotates along with the bucket is that shear forces act until the steady rotating flow is achieved. By neglecting viscosity we can not model this initial phase of the flow but we can model the steady flow that is achieved eventually.\nWe now want to show that \\(\\underline{u}\\) satisfies the Euler equations and find the pressure \\(p\\). We will then see that Euler’s equations can tell us the shape of the surface of the water in the rotating bucket. You probably know from personal observation that you expect the surface to be higher towards the rim of the bucket than in the middle because the centrifugal force presses water outwards. We will easily find the exact shape.\n\nWe have written Euler’s equations in vector notation. Let’s expand them in components. Let the \\(z\\) axis be directed vertically up, then \\(\\underline{g}=(0,0,-g)\\). The equations for the material derivatives of the components of \\(\\underline{u}\\) are. \\[\\begin{split}\n&\\partial_t u_x + \\left(u_x \\partial_x + u_y \\partial_y + u_z \\partial_z\\right) u_x = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\, \\partial_x p ,\\\\\n&\\partial_t u_y + \\left(u_x \\partial_x + u_y \\partial_y + u_z \\partial_z\\right) u_y = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\, \\partial_y p ,\\\\\n&\\partial_t u_z + \\left(u_x \\partial_x + u_y \\partial_y + u_z \\partial_z\\right) u_z = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\, \\partial_z p - g.\n\\end{split} \\tag{11.13}\\] Also, we have the incompressibility condition \\[\n\\partial_x u_x  + \\partial_y u_y  + \\partial_z u_z =0.\n\\tag{11.14}\\] Thus, we have 4 equations for 4 unknowns: three components of the velocity, \\(u_x\\), \\(u_y\\) and \\(u_z\\), and pressure, \\(p\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe pressure cannot be uniquely determined from Eq. 11.13, because if \\(\\underline{u}(\\underline{x},t)\\) and \\(p(\\underline{x},t)\\) represent a solution, then \\(\\underline{u}(\\underline{x},t)\\) and \\(p(\\underline{x},t)+f(t)\\) for arbitrary function \\(f\\) is also a solution. To determine the pressure uniquely, we heed to impose some additional condition. For example, if we consider a flow in the whole space, we may require that the pressure at infinity is a given constant: \\(p(\\underline{x},t)\\to p_0=const\\) as \\(\\vert\\underline{x}\\vert\\to \\infty\\).\n\n\nFirst we check that the flow with \\(\\underline{u}=(-y,x,0)\\) is incompressible, i.e., that Eq. 11.14 is satisfied. We find \\[\n\\partial_x u_x  + \\partial_y u_y  + \\partial_z u_z\n=\\partial_x (- y)  + \\partial_y x  + \\partial_z 0 =0.\n\\tag{11.15}\\] So the flow is incompressible and thus can be the flow of an ideal fluid.\nSubstituting \\(\\underline{u}=(-y,x,0)\\) into Eq. 11.13, most terms are zero and we get \\[\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nx \\partial_y(- y) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\, \\partial_x p ,  \\\\\n- y\\partial_x\\, x = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\, \\partial_y p ,   \\\\\n0 = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\, \\partial_z p - g \\nonumber\n\\end{array}\\right. \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\partial_x p = \\rho\\,x,  \\\\\n\\partial_y p = \\rho\\,y,  \\\\\n\\partial_z p = -\\rho \\, g\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\tag{11.16}\\] We see that these equations for the pressure do indeed have a solution: \\[\np=\\rho \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\, (x^2 + y^2) - g z\\right) +\\text{ constant}.\n\\tag{11.17}\\] This shows that this velocity field satisfies Euler’s equations and thus describes an ideal fluid with the given pressure.\nAt the surface of the water in the bucket the pressure is constant – equal to the atmospheric pressure. From that we can deduce that \\[\nz = \\frac{1}{2g}(x^2+y^2) +\\text{ constant}.\n\\tag{11.18}\\] Thus the surface of the water is a perfect paraboloid.\n\n\n\n\nAcheson, D. J. 1990.

    "text": "12.1 Bernoulli’s principle\n\n\nIn this section we will derive two theorems that make precise the principle discovered by Daniel Bernoulli in the 18th century that as the speed of a fluid increases, the pressure of the fluid decreases. This will later allow us to understand the origin of the lift force on an aerofoil, but of course has many other important practical applications.\nTo facilitate the derivation of Bernoulli’s theorems, we will make two observations that allow us to rewrite Euler’s equations in new ways.\n\nBecause gravity is a conservative force, it can be written as minus the gradient of a potential: \\(\\underline{g}= -\\underline{\\nabla}\\chi\\). Hence, Eq. 11.11 can also be written as \\[\n\\frac{D\\underline{u}}{Dt} = - \\underline{\\nabla} \\left(\\frac{p}{\\rho} + \\chi\\right).\n\\tag{12.1}\\] In the simple case where gravitational force is constant and in the negative \\(z\\) direction, \\(\\chi = g\\,z\\) so that \\(\\underline{g} = -g\\,\\underline{e}_z\\).\nWe will use the vector calculus identity \\[\n(\\underline{u}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{u} = (\\underline{\\nabla}\\times\\underline{u})\\times\\underline{u}+\\underline{\\nabla}\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right),\n\\tag{12.2}\\] which holds for any differentiable vector field \\(\\underline{u}\\) and thus in particular for the velocity field.

If we also introduce the function \\[\nH=\\frac{p}{\\rho} + \\frac{u^2}{2} + \\chi,\n\\tag{12.6}\\] sometimes known as Bernoulli’s integral, we can write Euler’s equation simply as \\[\n\\partial_t\\underline{u}+\\underline{\\omega}\\times\\underline{u} = - \\underline{\\nabla} H.\n\\tag{12.7}\\]\n\nThis simplifies even further if we consider a steady steady flow, so that \\(\\partial_t\\underline{u}=0\\). Then Eq. 12.7 simplifies to \\[\n\\underline{\\omega}\\times\\underline{u}=-\\underline{\\nabla} H.\n\\tag{12.8}\\] To get rid of the vector product in this equation, we take the dot product with \\(\\underline{u}\\) on both sides: \\[\n\\underline{u}\\cdot(\\underline{\\omega}\\times\\underline{u})=-\\underline{u}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla} H.\n\\tag{12.9}\\] On the left hand side the cross product \\(\\underline{\\omega}\\times\\underline{u}\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\underline{u}\\) so that the dot product with \\(\\underline{u}\\) is zero. So the left-hand side of the above equation is zero and we have \\[\n\\underline{u}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla} H=0.\n\\tag{12.10}\\] In words this says that the derivative of \\(H\\) in the direction of the flow, i.e., along streamlines, is zero, which gives:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 12.1 (Bernoulli’s streamline theorem) If an ideal fluid is in steady flow then \\[\nH=\\frac{p}{\\rho} + \\frac{u^2}{2} + \\chi\n\\tag{12.11}\\] is constant along streamlines.\n\n\n\n\nTo keep \\(H\\) constant, higher velocity must correspond to lower pressure, and vice versa. So we notice Bernoulli’s principle. But notice that this is only true along each individual streamline. This theorem says nothing about how \\(H\\) varies between streamlines.\nNext we restrict ourselves to flows where there is no vorticity, \\(\\underline{\\omega} = 0\\). Such flows are called irrotational flows. In this case Eq. 12.8 implies that \\(\\underline{\\nabla} H=0\\), which together with \\(\\partial_t H=0\\) gives us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 12.2 (Bernoulli’s theorem for irrotational flow) If an ideal fluid is in steady irrotational flow then \\[\nH=\\frac{p}{\\rho} + \\frac{u^2}{2} + \\chi\n\\tag{12.12}\\] is constant.\n\n\n\n\nThis theorem determines the pressure in a steady, irrotational ideal fluid once the velocity is known.\nWe can use this theorem to explain the lift created by the airflow around an aerofoil: because the air flows faster along the top of the aerofoil than along the bottom, there is a lower pressure above the aerofoil than below. However this is not a complete explanation until we have answered two questions:\n\nWhy is the flow irrotational?\nWhy is the velocity higher along the top?\n\nWe’ll address the first question in the next section and the second question in the following lectures."

This flow is parallel to the \\(x\\) axis, with the magnitude of the velocity increasing with increasing \\(y\\). The streamlines are simply straight horizontal lines parallel to the \\(x\\) axis. These are also the pathlines because this is a steady flow. So nothing flows in circles, so one might be tempted to guess that this is an irrotational flow. However the calculation shows that \\[\\begin{split}\n\\underline{\\omega}&= \\underline{\\nabla}\\times\\underline{u}=(\\partial_y\\underline{u}_z-\\partial_z\\underline{u}_y, \\partial_z\\underline{u}_x-\\partial_x\\underline{u}_z, \\partial_x\\underline{u}_y-\\partial_y\\underline{u}_x)\\\\\n&=(0,0,-\\partial_y\\underline{u}_x)=(0,0,-\\alpha)\\neq \\underline{0}.\n\\end{split} \\tag{12.14}\\] So there is a non-zero vorticity – the flow is not irrotational. To see this intuitively, imagine placing an extended object into the flow. If you want to do this in your bathtub, I recommend gluing two matches together to form a cross and place this on the water surface. If you now create a flow, this object may start to rotate. It will do so in the flow in this example because the upper end of the object finds itself in an area of faster flow while the lower end is in an area of slower flow, so the object will rotate clockwise.\n\n\n12.2.1 The evolution of vorticity\nTo derive an equation which governs the evolution of vorticity, we take the \\(curl\\) of Euler’s equation in the form given in Eq. 12.7. \\[\n\\underline{\\nabla}\\times\\partial_t\\underline{u}+\\underline{\\nabla}\\times(\\underline{\\omega}\\times\\underline{u})=-\\underline{\\nabla}\\times\\underline{\\nabla} H.\n\\tag{12.15}\\] Using the fact that \\(curl\\) of \\(grad\\) is zero, we obtain \\[\n\\partial_t\\underline{\\omega} + \\underline{\\nabla}\\times(\\underline{\\omega}\\times \\underline{u}) = \\underline{0}.\n\\tag{12.16}\\] We will now use the general vector calculus identity \\[\n\\underline{\\nabla}\\times(\\underline{a}\\times\\underline{b})=(\\underline{\\nabla}\\cdot\\underline{b})\\underline{a}+(\\underline{b}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{a}-(\\underline{\\nabla}\\cdot\\underline{a})\\underline{b}-(\\underline{a}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{b}\n\\tag{12.17}\\] which holds for any two differentiable vector fields \\(\\underline{a}\\) and \\(\\underline{b}\\). Applying this with \\(\\underline{a}=\\underline{\\omega}\\) and \\(\\underline{b}=\\underline{u}\\) gives \\[\n\\partial_t\\underline{\\omega} + (\\underline{\\nabla}\\cdot\\underline{u})\\underline{\\omega}+(\\underline{u}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{\\omega}-(\\underline{\\nabla}\\cdot\\underline{\\omega})\\underline{u}-(\\underline{\\omega}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{u}= \\underline{0}.\n\\tag{12.18}\\] Using the incompressibility condition \\(\\underline{\\nabla}\\cdot\\underline{u}=0\\) and the fact that the \\(div\\) of a \\(curl\\) is zero and thus \\(\\underline{\\nabla}\\cdot\\underline{\\omega}=0\\), the above simplifies to \\[\n\\partial_t\\underline{\\omega} + (\\underline{u}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{\\omega} = (\\underline{\\omega}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{u}.\n\\tag{12.19}\\] Using the definition of the material derivative we obtain the\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVorticity equation\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\frac{D\\underline{\\omega}}{Dt} = (\\underline{\\omega}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{u}.\n\\tag{12.20}\\]\n\n\nNote that the pressure \\(p\\) does not appear in the vorticity equation.\nThis simplifies for a 2D flow \\(\\underline{u}=(u_x(x,y,t), u_y(x,y,t),0)\\). In the calculation of the vorticity most terms vanish leaving only \\[\n\\underline{\\omega}=\\underline{\\nabla}\\times\\underline{u}=(0,0,\\omega)~~~\\text{ with } \\omega = \\partial_x u_y-\\partial_y u_x.\n\\tag{12.21}\\] Then \\[\n(\\underline{\\omega}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla})\\underline{u} = \\omega \\, \\partial_z \\underline{u}=\\underline{0}\n\\tag{12.22}\\] because there is no \\(z\\) dependence in the 2D flow. As a result, the vorticity equation Eq. 12.20 reduces to \\[\n\\frac{D\\omega}{Dt}=0.\n\\tag{12.23}\\] Thus:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 12.3 (Conservation of vorticity) In a 2D flow, the vorticity of each fluid particle is conserved, i.e., the vorticity is constant along each pathline.\n\n\n\n\nThis now allows us to answer our first question on the way to understanding the lift on an aerofoil. If we assume that far away in front of the aerofoil the air is still and thus described by a flow with no vorticity, then the vorticity stays zero along the paths of all the air molecules also as the aerofoil passes. Thus the entire flow is irrotational and we can apply Bernoulli’s theorem for irrotational flows to argue that the aerofoil experiences a lift force. All we still need to establish is that the velocity is higher above the aerofoil than below. That is going to occupy us for the next three lectures.\nVorticity is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics that plays a critical role in determining the behaviour of a fluid flow. It is closely related to the formation of vortices, the conservation of angular momentum, and the formation of turbulence. We’ll leave all of this for later modules.\n\n\n\n\nBatchelor, G. K. 2000.

This splits the integral into three bits: \\[\\begin{split}\n\\phi(\\underline{x})&=\\int_0^x u_x(\\tilde{x},0,0)\\,d\\tilde x+\\int_0^y u_y(x,\\tilde{y},0)\\,d\\tilde y+\\int_0^z u_y(x,y,\\tilde{z})\\,d\\tilde z\\\\\n&=\\int_0^x a\\tilde{x}\\,d\\tilde x+\\int_0^y (bx+c\\tilde{y})\\,d\\tilde y-\\int_0^z (a+c)\\tilde z\\,d\\tilde z\\\\\n&=\\frac{a}{2}x^2+bxy+\\frac{c}{2}y^2-\\frac{a+c}{2}z^2.\n\\end{split} \\tag{13.6}\\]\nAlternatively, and equivalently, we can find \\(\\phi\\) by solving the component differential equations contained in \\(\\underline{u}=\\underline{\\nabla} \\phi\\): \\[\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nax+by = \\partial_x\\phi,  \\\\\nbx+cy = \\partial_y\\phi,  \\\\\n-(a+c)z = \\partial_z\\phi,\n\\end{array}\\right. \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\phi= \\frac{a}{2}x^2 + bxy+ f(y,z),  \\\\\n\\phi=  bxy+\\frac{c}{2}y^2 + g(x,z),  \\\\\n\\phi= - \\frac{a+c}{2} z^2+ h(x,y)\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\tag{13.7}\\] The last three equations must represent the same function.

    "text": "14.2 Circulation\n\n\nWe now look at a flow around a rotating cylinder, in which the air close to the cylinder is rotating along with it, as depicted in the second flow in Figure 14.1. 1 We start with the complex potential \\[\nw(z)=i a \\log z.\n\\tag{14.3}\\] This is holomorphic outside the cylinder.1 Of course in a perfectly inviscid fluid the cylinder would not be able to drag the fluid along with it due to the absence of shear forces, so we can not describe how this circulating flow is created, but once it is established we can describe it.\nWe find the velocity field from the derivative \\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dw}{dz} &= \\frac{ia}{z}=\\frac{ia}{x+iy}=\\frac{ia(x-iy)}{x^2+y^2}\\\\\n&=\\frac{ay}{x^2+y^2}-i\\frac{-ax}{x^2+y^2}.\n\\end{split} \\tag{14.4}\\] Introducing \\(r^2=x^2+y^2\\) we read off the velocity components \\[\nu_x=\\frac{a}{r^2}y ~~\\text{ and }~~ u_y=-\\frac{a}{r^2}x.\n\\tag{14.5}\\] This is similar to the circular flow from Example 10.1 just with an extra factor of \\(-a/r^2\\), so this flow too is a circular flow, but with its angular velocity \\(\\Omega\\) decreasing with increasing distance from the centre, \\(\\Omega=-a/r\\). It is easy to look at this in polar coordinates: we simply need to write \\(z=re^{i\\theta}\\). We then have \\[\\begin{split}\nw(z)&=i a \\log z=ia\\log\\left( re^{i\\theta}\\right)\\\\\n&=ia\\left( \\log r+i\\theta\\right)=-a\\theta+ia\\log r.\n\\end{split} \\tag{14.6}\\] So the velocity potential is \\(\\phi=-a\\theta\\) and the stream function is \\(\\psi = a\\log r\\). The streamlines are lines of constant \\(\\psi\\), so lines of constant \\(r\\), hence circles centred on the origin.\nRemember that any flow described by a complex potential is irrotational. Yes, the fluid rotates around the origin, but an extended particle placed in the fluid does not rotate around its own axis. Now, if you do not believe this, in spite of the maths, you can also do the experiment. You can create something close to this flow by filling your bathroom sink and then pulling out the stopper. You will observe that the angular velocity of the water decreases with the distance from the plughole. If you glue together two matches to form a cross and place them on the water, you will see the cross circling the plughole, but without rotating around its own axis. Instead its orientation will stay constant. The vorticity of the flow is zero. To make the situation even more perverse, this flow is called the line vortex flow, in spite of its zero vorticity.\nWhile the line vortex flow is irrotational, it has non-zero circulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition 14.1 The circulation \\(\\Gamma\\) of a velocity field along a closed curve \\(C\\) is the line integral of the velocity field along that closed curve, \\[\n\\Gamma = \\oint_C \\underline{u}\\cdot d\\underline{x}.\n\\tag{14.7}\\]\n\n\n\n\nThus the circulation is a measure of the net flow of fluid around the curve, and it contains information about the strength and direction of the fluid motion. If as the closed curve we choose the surface of an obstacle to the flow, like the cylinder in our example, we get the circulation around that obstacle. We will see that the lift force experienced by the object is proportional to that circulation.\nThe circulation is a scalar quantity that can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the direction and strength of the fluid flow. If the fluid flows around the curve in a clockwise direction, the circulation is negative, and if it flows in a counterclockwise direction, the circulation is positive. If there is no net flow around the curve, the circulation is zero.\nAccording to Stoke’s theorem, \\[\n\\oint_C \\underline{u}\\cdot d\\underline{x}=\\int_S(\\underline{\\nabla}\\times\\underline{u})\\cdot d\\boldsymbol{S} ,\n\\tag{14.8}\\] where \\(S\\) is a surface enclosed by \\(C\\). If the flow is irrotational, so that \\(\\underline{\\nabla}\\times\\underline{u}=\\underline{0}\\), this seems to indicate that the circulation will always be zero. However this argument only works if the vector field is defined everywhere on the surface \\(S\\). This will not be the case if the curve \\(C\\) encircles a line along which the vector field is not defined. This is the case for the line vortex flow, which is undefined along the entire \\(z\\) axis.\nFor a two-dimensional flow with a complex potential \\(w\\), the line integral for the circulation \\(\\Gamma\\) in Eq. 14.7 can be written as a contour integral in the complex plane. To derive this we start with the fact that \\(dw/dz=u_x-iu_y\\). Hence \\[\\begin{split}\n\\oint_C\\frac{dw}{dz}dz&=\\oint_C(u_x-iu_y)(dx+idy)\\\\\n&=\\oint_C(u_x\\,dx+u_y\\,dy)-i\\oint_C(u_y\\,dx-u_x\\,dy)\n\\end{split} \\tag{14.9}\\] Thus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\Gamma = \\oint_C \\underline{u}\\cdot d\\underline{x}=\\oint_C(u_x\\,dx+u_y\\,dy)=\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\oint_C\\frac{dw}{dz}dz\\right).\n\\tag{14.10}\\]\n\n\n\nIn the example of the vortex flow with the complex potential \\(w=ia\\log z\\) this gives \\[\n\\Gamma = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\oint_C\\frac{ia}{z}dz\\right)=-2\\pi\\,a.\n\\tag{14.11}\\] The contour integral was easy to perform thanks to Cauchy’s residue theorem. It is nice to see how vector calculus and complex analysis merge to be helpful in fluid dynamics."

    "text": "14.3 Magnus effect\n\n\nWe now explain the Magnus effect, whereby a spinning cylinder in an air flow will experience a force perpendicular to the airflow. This is similar to the phenomenon of curve balls, except that the flow around the cylinder can be described by a two-dimensional flow unlike the flow around a spinning ball.\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: The flow around a rotating cylinder moving through still air is obtained as the sum of the flows from the previous sections, which individually did not create a lift force.\n\n\nThe idea is that near the rotating cylinder the air is dragged along, leading to a flow as depicted in Figure 14.1, with a faster flow above the cylinder than below the cylinder. This flow can be obtained by adding a line vertex flow (see Section 14.2) to the flow around the non-rotating cylinder (see Section 14.1. If we add two complex potentials, we again obtain a valid complex potential (because the sum of two holomorphic functions is again holomorphic). So we use the complex potential \\[\nw(z)=a\\left(z+\\frac{R^2}{z}\\right)+ib\\log z.\n\\tag{14.12}\\] The stagnation points – the points at which the flow velocity is zero – are where the velocity of the line-vortex flow exactly cancels the velocity of the flow around the non-rotating cylinder. They are moved downwards by the clockwise rotation of the cylinder.\nBernoulli’s theorem for irrotational flow gives us the pressure as \\[\np = -\\frac{\\rho}{2}u^2 + \\text{ constant}.\n\\tag{14.13}\\] We do not care about the value of the constant because the force is caused only by pressure differences. In order to calculate the force acting on the cylinder we need to calculate the pressure everywhere on the surface of the cylinder, so we need the velocities there. We calculate these by taking the derivative of the complex potential and evaluating it at \\(z=Re^{i\\theta}\\), \\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{dw}{dz}&=a\\left(1-\\frac{R^2}{z^2}\\right)+\\frac{ib}{z}=a\\left(1-e^{-2i\\theta}\\right)+\\frac{ib}{R}e^{-i\\theta}\\\\\n&=e^{-i\\theta}\\left( 2ia\\sin(\\theta)+\\frac{ib}{R}\\right).\n\\end{split} \\tag{14.14}\\] From this we get the square of the velocity as \\[\\begin{split}\nu^2&=u_x^2+u_y^2=(u_x-iu_y)(u_x+iu_y)=\\left|\\frac{dw}{dz}\\right|^2\\\\\n&=\\left(2a\\sin\\theta-\\frac{b}{R}\\right)^2\n\\end{split} \\tag{14.15}\\] and thus the pressure at the surface of the cylinder is \\[\np(\\theta)=-2\\rho\\left(a^2\\sin^2\\theta-a\\frac{b}{R}\\sin\\theta\\right) +\\text{ constant}.\n\\tag{14.16}\\] This now allows us to calculate the force \\(dF\\) on an infinitesimal angular segment of the cylinder between \\(\\theta\\) and \\(\\theta+d\\theta\\). The force is constant along the length of the cylinder, so we calculate just the force per unit length. According to the definition of the pressure this force is \\[\nd\\underline{F}(\\theta) = -p(\\theta)\\,\\underline{n}\\, dl = -p(\\theta)\\,\\underline{n}  R\\,d\\theta.\n\\tag{14.17}\\] where \\(\\underline{n}\\) is the outwards normal. We are interested in the \\(y\\) component of this: \\[\ndF_y(\\theta) = -p(\\theta)\\,R\\sin\\theta  \\,d\\theta.\n\\tag{14.18}\\] Integrating this over the entire circle of radius \\(R\\) gives \\[\\begin{split}\nF_y&=-\\int_0^{2\\pi}p(\\theta)\\,R\\sin\\theta\\,d\\theta\\\\\n&=\\int_0^{2\\pi}2\\rho\\left(a^2\\sin^3\\theta-a\\frac{b}{R}\\sin^2\\theta\\right)R\\,d\\theta\\\\\n&=2\\pi\\rho\\, a\\, b.\n\\end{split} \\tag{14.19}\\] So we have derived that the cylinder experiences a non-zero lift force that is proportional to the air density, the velocity of the air flow, and the angular velocity of the cylinder.\nI encourage you to also calculate the \\(x\\) component of the force and to discuss the result."

    "text": "14.4 A comment on units and dimensions\nWhen describing the real world, quantities have units and dimensions. For example, the radius of a cylinder has dimension of length and can be measured in either meters or feet or centimetres or … There are three ways to deal with this:\n\nAgree on a system of units and measure everything in terms of these units. The most common system is the SI system, where length is measured in meters (m), time - in seconds (s), mass - in kilograms (kg). So we would write \\[\n\\text{radius }=R \\text{ meters}\n\\] and then work with \\(R\\) in our formulas. This seems natural to a mathematician because it means that the mathematician never has to think about units and dimensions because there is an agreed way to express all quantities as just numbers. But one looses some benefits.\nChoose units that are natural for the problem at hand. For example if the radius of the cylinder is the most important length in the problem, then it is natural to measure all other lengths as multiples of this radius. This has the nice effect that \\[\n\\text{radius } =1 \\text{ radius}.\n\\] None of the formulas will ever have to involve a parameter \\(R\\). By similarly choosing a natural time and a natural mass, we can get rid of 3 parameters. This is why applied mathematicians sometimes like this approach because it leads to simpler expressions. It goes by the name of “non-dimensionalisation”. Theoretical physicists use it to set \\(c=\\hbar=G=1\\).\nDon’t specify units and keep all quantities as dimensionful quantities. So \\[\n\\text{radius }=R.\n\\] This has the disadvantage over the previous approach that it does not reduce the number of parameters. But it has the advantage that we have an easy way to check whether the equations we derive make sense. If in any equation the different terms do not all have the same dimension, then we know we have made a mistake. For people like me who make mistakes very easily, this is very valuable.\n\nIt is clear that the first approach above has no advantages, because it neither decreases the number of parameters in the equations nor gives us a way to use the dimensions of the terms in the equation as a check. Nevertheless, unfortunately, it is often adopted by mathematicians and we did so in this lecture. Take a look for example in Eq. 14.12 : \\[\nw(z)=a\\left(z+\\frac{R^2}{z}\\right)+ib\\log z.\n\\] The fact that it contains \\(\\log z\\) shows that \\(z\\) is dimensionless (because you can’t take the log of a dimensionful number). Thus we did not take approach 3. The fact that it still contains \\(R\\) means that we did not take approach 2, i.e., \\(z\\) is not measured in multiples of \\(R\\).\nWe will switch to using approach 3 for the rest of the module to always have a check on the results.\n\n\n\n\nAcheson, D.

For this purpose we first consider the force \\(d\\underline{F}\\) on an infinitesimal segment of length \\(dl\\) of the cross section of the aerofoil. In terms of the angle \\(\\theta\\) that is indicated in Figure 15.1 we have \\[\ndF_x = p\\cos\\theta\\,dl,~~~dF_x = -p\\sin\\theta\\,dl,\n\\tag{15.2}\\] and thus \\[\ndF_x - i\\, dF_y = p\\,(\\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta)\\,dl = p\\,e^{i\\theta} dl.\n\\tag{15.3}\\] Notice how by reinterpreting the \\(x\\)-\\(y\\) plane as the complex plane we can avoid having to deal with sines and cosines.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Force \\(d\\underline{F}\\) acting on an infinitesimal segment \\(dl\\).\n\n\nThe flow is tangential to the aerofoil, so the velocity components are \\[\nu_x=|u|\\sin\\theta,~~~u_y=|u|\\cos\\theta.\n\\tag{15.4}\\] We can relate that to the derivative of the complex potential, \\[\n\\frac{dw}{dz} = u_x-i u_y\n=|u|\\left(\\sin\\theta-i\\cos\\theta\\right)=-i|u|e^{i\\theta},\n\\tag{15.5}\\] and thus \\[\n|u|=ie^{-i\\theta}\\frac{dw}{dz}.\n\\tag{15.6}\\] This makes it easy to calculate \\[\nu^2=-e^{-2i\\theta}\\left(\\frac{dw}{dz}\\right)^2.\n\\tag{15.7}\\] We can use this in Bernoulli’s theorem for irrotational flow (in the absence of body forces) to find the pressure \\[\np =-\\frac{\\rho}{2}u^2+constant=\\frac{\\rho}{2}e^{-2i\\theta}\\left(\\frac{dw}{dz}\\right)^2+constant.\n\\tag{15.8}\\] The value of the constant is irrelevant because only pressure differences create forces.

    "text": "15.3 Conformal mappings\n\n\nFrom the previous lecture we have a flow around a cylindrical aerofoil. We want the flow around a less symmetrical shape that is rounded at the front but has a tip at the end. This is illustrated in Figure 15.2. We are going to use a conformal mapping that maps from one to the other.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: A conformal mapping \\(f\\) from the region \\(D\\) outside a disk \\(A\\) to the region \\(\\tilde{D}\\) outside the cross section \\(\\tilde{A}\\) of an aerofoil.\n\n\nLet \\(A\\) be the cross section of a cylindrical aerofoil, i.e., a closed disc, with radius \\(R\\), centred at \\(z=-\\lambda\\). Let \\(\\tilde{A}\\) be the desired cross section of the aerofoil. Then \\(D=\\mathbb{C}\\setminus A\\) and \\(\\tilde{D}=\\mathbb{C}\\setminus \\tilde{A}\\) are the regions outside the aerofoils.\nLet \\(f:D\\to\\tilde{D}\\) be a holomorphic invertible function. View this as a map from the region in one complex plane to another, which we will refer to as the \\(z\\) plane and the \\(\\tilde{z}\\) plane respectively, where \\(\\tilde{z}=f(z)=\\tilde{x}+i\\tilde{y}\\). We want to know what happens to the fluid flow under this map. We introduce the complex potential on \\(\\tilde{D}\\) to be everywhere identical to the complex potential at the corresponding point in \\(D\\), i.e., \\[\n\\tilde{w}(\\tilde{z})=w(z)=w(f^{-1}(\\tilde{z})).\n\\tag{15.20}\\] This is a holomorphic function on \\(\\tilde{D}\\). It gives us the vector potential \\(\\tilde{\\phi}\\) and the stream function \\(\\tilde{\\psi}\\) on \\(\\tilde{D}\\) as usual: \\[\n\\tilde{w}(\\tilde{z})=\\tilde{\\phi}(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y})+i\\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{x},\\tilde{y}).\n\\tag{15.21}\\] Because the stream function \\(\\tilde{\\psi}(\\tilde{z})\\) on \\(\\tilde{D}\\) takes the same values as the original stream function \\(\\psi\\) on the corresponding point on \\(D\\), the stream lines on \\(D\\) get mapped by \\(f\\) to streamlines on \\(\\tilde{D}\\). We can find the mapped velocity field on \\(\\tilde{D}\\) from the complex potential \\(\\tilde{w}\\) as \\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{d\\tilde{w}}{d\\tilde{z}}\n&=\\tilde{u}_x-i\\tilde{u}_y\n=\\frac{d}{d\\tilde{z}}w\\left(f^{-1}(\\tilde{z})\\right)\\\\\n&=\\frac{dw}{dz}\\frac{df^{-1}(\\tilde{z})}{d\\tilde{z}}\n=\\frac{dw/dz}{f'},\n\\end{split} \\tag{15.22}\\] where we used that the derivative of the inverse function \\(f^{-1}\\) is the reciprocal of the derivative of the function \\(f\\). Thus we find that the components of the velocity field are simply rescaled by \\(f'\\) at every point.\nWe now consider how angles behave under the mapping \\(f\\). See Figure 15.3 for a drawing illustrating the following discussion. We consider an infinitesimal line from some point \\(z_0\\) to point \\(z_0+\\delta z\\) for some infinitesimally small \\(\\delta z\\). This gets mapped into a line from \\(\\tilde{z}_0=f(z_0)\\) to \\[\\begin{split}\n\\tilde{z}_0+\\delta\\tilde{z}&=f(z_0+\\delta z)\\\\\n&=f(z_0)+\\delta z\\,f'(z_0)+\\frac{(\\delta z)^2}{2}f''(z_0)+\\\\\n&\\qquad\\cdots\n+\\frac{(\\delta z)^n}{n!}f^{(n)}(z_0)+\\cdots\n\\end{split} \\tag{15.23}\\] In the case where \\(f^{(n)}(z_0)=0\\) for all \\(n<m\\) and \\(f^{(m)}(z_0)\\neq 0\\) this gives \\[\n\\delta\\tilde{z}=f(z_0+\\delta z)=\\frac{(\\delta z)^m}{m!}f^{(m)}(z_0)+\\text{ higher-order terms}.\n\\tag{15.24}\\] The higher-order terms can be neglected for infinitesimal \\(\\delta z\\). For the angle that the line segments make with the horizontal we find \\[\n\\operatorname{arg}(\\delta \\tilde{z})=m\\,\\operatorname{arg}(\\delta z) + \\operatorname{arg}(f^{(m)}(z_0)).\n\\tag{15.25}\\]\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: A figure illustrating the change in angle under the holomorphic mapping \\(f\\).\n\n\nLet us now consider a second infinitesimal line element from \\(z_0\\) to \\(z_0+\\delta z_2\\), which gets mapped into a line from \\(\\tilde{z}_0\\) to \\(\\tilde{z}_0+\\delta\\tilde{z}_2\\) and consider the angle \\[\n\\theta = \\operatorname{arg}(\\delta z_2) - \\operatorname{arg}(\\delta z)\n\\tag{15.26}\\] between them.

The point \\(z=-c\\) lies inside the aerofoil and the point \\(z=c\\) on its surface.\nWe now start with the flow around the cylinder discussed in the section on the Magnus effect, described by the complex potential \\[\nw(z)=a\\left(z+\\frac{R^2}{z}\\right)+ib\\log z.\n\\tag{15.31}\\] We rotate everything by an angle \\(\\alpha\\) counterclockwise and shift the centre of the cylinder to the left by \\(\\lambda\\) . This is achieved by replacing \\(z\\) by \\((z+\\lambda)e^{-i\\alpha}\\). We also make the argument of the logarithm dimensionless by dividing by \\(R\\), see discussion in section Section 14.4. This thus gives the flow on the left in Figure 15.4.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: The Joukowski mapping \\(f\\) maps the flow around the cylinder to the flow around the aerofoil.\n\n\nWe set \\(b=-\\Gamma/(2\\pi R)\\). So we use \\[\nw(z)=a\\left((z+\\lambda)e^{-i\\alpha}+\\frac{R^2}{z+\\lambda}e^{i\\alpha}\\right)-\\frac{i\\Gamma}{2\\pi R}\\log\\frac{z+\\lambda}{R}.\n\\tag{15.32}\\] From the derivative of this complex potential \\[\n\\frac{dw}{dz}=a\\left(e^{-i\\alpha}-\\dfrac{R^2}{(z+\\lambda)^2}e^{i\\alpha}\\right)-\\dfrac{i\\Gamma}{2\\pi}\\dfrac{1}{z+\\lambda}\n\\tag{15.33}\\] we see that far away we have constant flow at an angle \\(\\alpha\\) to the horizontal: \\[\\begin{split}\n\\lim_{|z|\\to\\infty}\\frac{dw}{dz}\n&=a\\,e^{-i\\alpha}=a\\cos\\alpha-ia\\sin\\alpha\\\\\n&=u_x(\\infty)-iu_y(\\infty).\n\\end{split} \\tag{15.34}\\] By calculating the contour integral along a contour surrounding the aerofoil using Cauchy’s residue theorem we find that the circulation is \\[\n\\oint_C\\frac{dw}{dz}dz=2\\pi i\\left(-\\dfrac{i\\Gamma}{2\\pi}\\right)=\\Gamma.\n\\tag{15.35}\\]\nWe can now use Eq. 15.22 to find the velocity field after applying the conformal mapping \\(f\\): \\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{d\\tilde{w}}{d\\tilde{z}}\n&=\\frac{dw/dz}{f'}\\\\\n&=\\frac{a\\left(e^{-i\\alpha}-\\dfrac{R^2}{(z+\\lambda)^2}e^{i\\alpha}\\right)-\\dfrac{i\\Gamma}{2\\pi}\\dfrac{1}{z+\\lambda}}\n{1-\\dfrac{(R-\\lambda)^2}{z^2}}.\n\\end{split} \\tag{15.36}\\] We note that due to the zero of the denominator at \\(z=R-\\lambda\\) the velocity is infinite at that point unless the numerator vanishes at that point, i.e., unless \\[\n\\Gamma = -4\\pi a R\\sin\\alpha.\n\\tag{15.37}\\] The cusp at the rear of the aerofoil forces the airflow to have this particular amount of circulation.\nWe can therefore now use the Kutta-Joukowski theorem to determine the lift force: \\[\\begin{split}\nF_x&=\\rho\\Gamma u_y(\\infty)=4\\pi\\rho \\,a^2\\, R\\sin\\alpha(-\\sin\\alpha),\\\\\nF_y&=-\\rho\\Gamma u_y(\\infty)=4\\pi\\rho \\,a^2\\, R\\sin\\alpha(\\cos\\alpha).\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{15.38}\\]\nWe used the fact that the mapping did not change the velocity far away and did not change the circulation because \\(\\tilde{w}(\\tilde{z})=w(z)\\) and thus \\[\n\\oint_C \\frac{d\\tilde{w}}{d\\tilde{z}}d\\tilde{z}=\\oint_{f^{-1}(C)}\\frac{dw}{dz}dz=\\Gamma,\n\\tag{15.39}\\] due to the fact that the contour \\(f^{-1}(C)\\) also surrounds the cylinder in the counterclockwise direction.\nWe have thus found that the lift force is acting at an angle \\(\\alpha\\) to the vertical and has a magnitude of \\[\n4\\pi\\rho \\,a^2\\, R\\sin\\alpha.\n\\tag{15.40}\\]\n\n\n\n\nAcheson, D.

    "text": "16.1 Surface conditions\nWe consider the interface between the water and the air. We use the fact that the density of the air is negligible compared to that of water and thus treat the surface as a free surface. At such a surface there are two conditions: the kinematic surface condition and the dynamic surface condition, which we will introduce in the next two subsections.\n\n16.1.1 Kinematic condition\n\n\nThe kinematic condition states that fluid particles on the surface stay on the surface.\nIf we introduce the distance \\(d\\) of a point from the surface \\[\nd(x,y,t)=y-\\eta(x,t)\n\\tag{16.2}\\] then the particles at the surface have \\(d=0\\) and this will stay constant as the particle moves around, i.e., \\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{Dd}{Dt}&=\\partial_td+\\underline{u}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla} d=\\partial_td+u_x\\partial_x d+u_y\\partial_y d\\\\\n&=-\\partial_t\\eta-u_x\\partial_x \\eta+u_y=0.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{16.3}\\] This is the kinematic surface condition and holds at all points at the surface, i.e., all points with \\(y=\\eta(x,t)\\).\n\n\n16.1.2 Dynamic condition\n\n\nThe dynamic condition states that the pressure at the surface equals the atmospheric pressure \\(p_0\\).\nAccording to Euler’s equation \\[\n\\partial_t\\underline{u}+(\\underline{\\nabla}\\times\\underline{u})\\times\\underline{u}=-\\underline{\\nabla}\\left(\\frac{p}{\\rho}+\\frac12 u^2+\\chi\\right),\n\\tag{16.4}\\] where \\(p\\) is the pressure, \\(\\rho\\) is the density and \\(\\chi\\) is the gravitational potential. The left-hand side simplifies for an irrotational flow described by a velocity potential \\(\\phi\\), \\[\n\\underline{\\nabla}(\\partial_t\\phi)=-\\underline{\\nabla}\\left(\\frac{p}{\\rho}+\\frac12 u^2+\\chi\\right).\n\\tag{16.5}\\] We can integrate this to give \\[\n\\partial_t\\phi+\\frac{p}{\\rho}+\\frac12 u^2+\\chi=G(t)\n\\tag{16.6}\\] for some integration constant \\(G(t)\\). (Note that by ‘constant’ in this constant we mean independent of the spatial variables. A time dependence does not affect the gradient.) The gravitational potential is acting in the negative \\(y\\) direction, so \\(\\chi = g\\,y\\). At the surface \\(y=\\eta\\) we have \\(p=p_0\\), so \\[\n\\partial_t\\phi+\\frac12 u^2+g\\eta=G(t)-\\frac{p_0}{\\rho},\n\\tag{16.7}\\] where we have collected all the constant terms on the right-hand side. We now use that shifting a potential by a constant does not make a difference because it is only the gradient of the potential that is relevant. We can thus simplify the equation by shifting \\(\\phi \\to\\phi+s(t)\\) where we choose \\(s(t)\\) such that \\(s'(t)=G(t)-p_0/\\rho\\). This new potential satisfies \\[\n\\partial_t\\phi+\\frac12 u^2+g\\eta=0\n\\tag{16.8}\\] This is the dynamical surface condition and holds at all points at the surface, i.e., the points with \\(y=\\eta(x,t)\\)."

We can easily find the solutions describing such circular waves by switching to polar coordinates \\(r\\), \\(\\theta\\) for the \\(x\\)-\\(z\\) plane such that \\(x=r\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(z=r\\sin\\theta\\).\nThe circular waves we are looking for look the same in all directions, so we will be looking for solutions for the velocity potential \\(\\phi\\) and the surface function \\(\\eta\\) that are independent of the \\(\\theta\\) coordinate: \\[\n\\phi = \\phi(r,y,t),~~~\\eta = \\eta(r,t).\n\\]\nThe Laplace equation for the velocity potential \\(\\phi\\) then becomes \\[\n0 = \\nabla^2\\phi=\\frac{1}{r}\\partial_r^2(r\\phi)+\\partial_y^2\\phi.\n\\tag{17.13}\\]\nIntroducing again the distance \\(d\\) from the surface, \\(d(r,y,t)=y-\\eta(r,t)\\), the kinematic surface condition in these coordinates is \\[\\begin{split}\n\\frac{Dd}{Dt}&=\\partial_td+\\underline{u}\\cdot\\underline{\\nabla} d=\\partial_td+u_r\\partial_r d+u_y\\partial_y d\\\\\n&=-\\partial_t\\eta-u_r\\partial_r \\eta+u_y=0.\n\\end{split}\n\\tag{17.14}\\] After linearisation this reduces to \\[\n\\partial_t\\eta(r,t)=u_y(r,0,t).\n\\tag{17.15}\\] This is the same as in the case of Carthesian coordinates, just with \\(r\\) taking the place of \\(x\\). Similarly the linearised dynamic surface condition becomes \\[\n\\partial_t\\phi(r,0,t)=-g\\eta(r,t).\n\\tag{17.16}\\] Thus the only difference between the problem of circular waves compared to the problem of plane waves we studied earlier is that the \\(\\partial_x^2\\phi\\) term in the Laplace equation has been replaced by \\(1/r \\partial_r^2(r\\phi)\\). This motivates us to make the modified Ansatz \\[\n\\phi(r,y,t) = f(y)\\frac{1}{r}\\sin(kr-\\omega t).\n\\] Substituting this into the Laplace equation -Eq. 17.13 again gives the equation \\(f''-k^2f\\) and imposing that the solution must stay finite as \\(y\\to-\\infty\\) singles out the solution \\(f(y)=D\\,e^{ky}\\) for some constant \\(D\\).
