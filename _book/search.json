    "text": "Welcome\nIn this module we will explore the the dynamics of continuous media, focusing on elementary fluid dynamics and the motion of waves. This lays the foundations for the full development of fluid dynamics in years 3 and 4, as well as for modules on electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. The mathematical techniques of vector calculus are employed and further developed, as are Fourier methods and methods from complex analysis.\nThe material in this module consists of two topics: Waves and Fluids. We will spend the first half of the term on Waves and the second half on Fluids. The topics are linked by the fact that both use partial differential equations to describe real-world phenomena in space and time. Of course they share this feature with a large part of Applied Mathematics. So you will meet the ideas and methods introduced in this module again and again in future Applied Mathematics modules. In some sense, the actual subject matter of this module is less important than the way of thinking that it introduces.\nThe module is meant to prepare you for going out into the world and confronting new phenomena with the power of mathematics, not only in physics, but in biology, ecology, medicine, sociology, economics, and other areas. There will be many modules in the third and fourth year of you studies that will deepen that ability.\nThroughout this module, we shall use SI units: length is measured in meters (m), time in seconds (s), mass in kilograms (kg).\nThese notes will be periodically revised.

    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nThe reason why waves are so fundamentally important is that waves are the way information is propagating. Some waves that propagate information are obvious: sound waves, light and radio waves, electric waves travelling along our neurons. Others are less obvious. Even if I communicate with you by shooting a particle at you, this too is described by a wave, as you will learn in quantum mechanics. Gravitational effects are communicated via gravitational waves.\nBecause waves propagate at a finite speed, also information can only propagate at that wave speed. This has profound impacts, as you know from the theory of special relativity. For example, we can look back into the past because some of the light waves emitted shortly after the big bang 16 billion years ago are only now arriving here, strongly red-shifted and thus detectable as microwaves.\nStudying waves is also of great practical importance. They play an important part in our technological world. Improvements in our understanding of how to generate and control electromagnetic waves, for example, has led to radio, radar and mobile phones. Understanding how a pest propagates in the form of an invasion wave into so-far uninfected territory allows us to prepare adequate interventions. Understanding how density waves form in traffic flow, leading to traffic jams, allows us to design interventions that lead to smoother traffic flow."

    "section": "1.2 Why waves on a string?",
    "text": "1.2 Why waves on a string?\nThe great diversity of waves in nature means that we need to choose some concrete wave phenomenon to concentrate on to start our investigation. In this module we will concentrate on the waves on a string (think of a guitar string) and generalise to waves on a membrane (think of the membrane of a drum). By studying this in detail you will develop the intuition and the skills that will allow you to understand other wave phenomena later. We’ll come back to waves at the end of the part on Fluid Dynamics when we study waves on the surface of a fluid.\nPersonally I like studying vibrating strings because they are at the foundation of superstring theory. This is a “Theory of Everything” that posits that elementary particles are actually tiny strings, with different vibrational states corresponding to different elementary particles. As a Ph.D. student I showed how, if these strings move in certain higher-dimensional group supermanifolds, they behave like the elementary particles of our standard model of particle physics, including the chiral fermions. If we ignore the bit about group supermanifolds for the moment, the maths behind string theory is no more complicated than the maths we will discuss in this module and the partner module on quantum mechanics.\nWe consider a flexible, elastic string of linear density \\(\\rho\\) (mass per unit length), which undergoes small transverse vibrations. (For example, it can be a guitar string.) The transverse vibrations mean that the displacements of each small element of the string is perpendicular to its length. We assume that the string does not move longitudinally (i.e. parallel to its length). Let \\(y(x, t)\\) be its displacement from equilibrium position at time \\(t\\) and position \\(x\\) (see Fig. Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A string stretched in the \\(x\\)-direction and vibrating in the \\(y\\)-direction.\n\n\nThe string is sufficiently simple, that we can understand it by pure thought. We will derive from first principles a PDE that describes its motion (the wave equation) and then solve it for various initial conditions. I find it amazing that this is possible.\nTo derive the equation of motion of the string we first need to discuss the force acting on it which we will do in the next section. Then in the section after that we can plug this into Newton’s second law and out pops the wave equation."

    "section": "1.3 Linearized tension force",
    "text": "1.3 Linearized tension force\nWe consider a small segment of the string between any two points \\(x\\) and at \\(x+\\delta x\\) as shown in Fig. Figure 1.2. We want to determine the force that is acting on this segment, so that we can later determine its motion using Newton’s second law. We will concentrate on only the tension force of the string and ignore less important effects like gravity, friction, or stiffness.\nWe assume that the tension force \\(\\boldsymbol{T}(x)\\) has constant magnitude throughout the string: \\(|\\boldsymbol{T}(x)|=T\\). However its direction varies along the string, because it always acts in the tangential direction. At interior points the tension force pulling to one side will balance that pulling in the other direction. The net tension force on the segment will thus be determined by the tension forces at its ends. We have drawn these forces schematically in Figure Figure 1.2 where we have also split them into their \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The tension forces acting on a segment of the string between \\(x\\) and \\(x+\\delta x\\).\n\n\nThe total force acting on the segment is \\[\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{T}(x+\\delta x)-\\boldsymbol{T}(x). \\tag{1.1}\\] We first consider the \\(y\\) component \\[T_y(x) = T\\sin\\theta(x), \\tag{1.2}\\] where \\(\\theta(x)\\) is the angle that the string makes with the horizontal at \\(x\\). The slope of the string at \\(x\\) is \\[\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = \\tan\\theta(x). \\tag{1.3}\\] We are now going to simplify the expressions by assuming that the slope and thus \\(\\theta\\) is small, \\(\\theta<<1\\). Then, by Taylor expansion, \\[\\sin\\theta = \\theta + O(\\theta^3), ~~~\\tan\\theta = \\theta + O(\\theta^2). \\tag{1.4}\\] We ignore all terms that are higher order in \\(\\theta\\). This is known as the linear approximation. It is done very often, because it leads to linear equations that are so much easier to solve. So \\[\\begin{split}\nF_y&=T_y(x+\\delta x) - T_y(x) \\\\\n&= T\\sin\\theta(x+\\delta x) -T\\sin\\theta(x)\\\\\n&\\approx T\\left(\\theta(x+\\delta x)-\\theta(x)\\right).\n\\end{split} \\tag{1.5}\\] We do another Taylor expansion and ignore higher-order terms in \\(\\delta x\\), which is fine because we want to look at only an infinitesimally small segment of string. \\[\\begin{split}\\theta(x+\\delta x)&=\\theta(x)+\\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}+O(\\delta x)^2\\\\\n&\\approx \\theta(x)+\\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}.\\end{split} \\tag{1.6}\\] Substituting this into Eq. 1.5 gives \\[F_y\\approx T \\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}. \\tag{1.7}\\] We would like to express this in terms of \\(y\\) instead of \\(\\theta\\), which we can do by observing that \\[\\theta\\approx\\tan\\theta=\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}, \\tag{1.8}\\] so we finally have \\[F_y\\approx T\\,\\delta x\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}. \\tag{1.9}\\]\nWe deal with the \\(x\\) component of the force similarly, using the Taylor expansion of \\(\\cos\\theta=1+O(\\theta^2)\\): \\[\\begin{split}F_x&=T_x(x+\\delta x)-T_x(x)\\\\\n&=T\\cos\\theta(x+\\delta_x)-T\\cos\\theta(x)\\\\\n&\\approx T-T=0.\\end{split} \\tag{1.10}\\] So in our approximation of small slope, there is no movement in the \\(x\\) direction. The string vibrates purely transversally."

The first of the two initial conditions prescribes the initial displacement of the string, the second the initial velocity.\nThe solution of this initial value problem can be found by substituting the general solution Eq. 2.12 into the initial conditions. This gives \\[y_0(x)=f(x)+g(x), \\tag{2.15}\\] \\[v_0(x)=-cf'(x) + cg'(x). \\tag{2.16}\\] So we have two equations for the two unknown functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\).

Once we have the d’Alembert formula, we can consider solutions of the initial-value problem (Eq. 2.13, Eq. 2.14) corresponding to piecewise smooth (or even piecewise continuous) initial functions \\(y_0(x)\\) and \\(v_0(x)\\). This will result in generalised solutions of the wave equation which are defined everywhere in the upper half of the \\((x,t)\\) plane except for a finite number of lines where values of \\(y(x,t)\\) and/or its first derivatives are discontinuous."
