    "text": "Welcome\nThese are the lecture notes for Waves and Fluids, part of the 2nd year Applied Maths module at the University of York in Spring 2023. Each chapter in these notes corresponds to one lecture.\nThese notes will be periodically revised. Whenever you spot something that is not quite right, please email me at gustav.delius@york.ac.uk or submit your correction in the correction form at https://forms.gle/w17c19vWnM7wpLpz7.\n\nIf you want to print these notes you should download the pdf version.\n\nThe material in this module consists of two topics: Waves and Fluids. We will spend the first half of the term on Waves and the second half on Fluids. The topics are linked by the fact that both use partial differential equations to describe real-world phenomena in space and time. Of course they share this feature with a large part of Applied Mathematics. So you will meet the ideas and methods introduced in this module again and again in future Applied Mathematics modules. In some sense, the actual subject matter of this module is less important than the way of thinking that it introduces.\nThe module is meant to prepare you for going out into the world and confronting new phenomena with the power of mathematics, not only in physics, but in biology, ecology, medicine, sociology, economics, and other areas. There will be many modules in the third and fourth year of you studies that will deepen that ability.\nThroughout this module, we shall use SI units: length is measured in meters (m), time in seconds (s), mass in kilograms (kg)."

    "text": "Waves are so fundamentally important because waves are the only way information can propagate in this universe. Some waves that propagate information are obvious: sound waves, light and radio waves, electric waves travelling along our neurons. Others are less obvious: even if I communicate with you by shooting a particle at you, this is described by a wave, as you will learn in quantum mechanics. Gravitational effects are communicated via gravitational waves.\nBecause waves propagate at a finite speed, also information can only propagate at that wave speed. This has profound impacts, as you know from the theory of special relativity. For example, we can look far back into the past because some of the light waves emitted shortly after the big bang 16 billion years ago are only now arriving here, strongly red-shifted and thus detectable as microwaves.\nStudying waves is also of great practical importance. They play an important part in our technological world. Improvements in our understanding of how to generate and control electromagnetic waves, for example, has led to radio, radar and mobile phones. Understanding how a pest propagates in the form of an invasion wave into so-far uninfected territory allows us to prepare adequate interventions. Understanding how density waves form in traffic flow, leading to traffic jams, allows us to design interventions that lead to smoother traffic flow."

    "section": "1.1 Why waves on a string?",
    "text": "1.1 Why waves on a string?\nThe great diversity of waves in nature means that we need to choose some concrete wave phenomenon to concentrate on to start our investigation. In this module we will concentrate on the waves on a string (think of a guitar string) and generalise to waves on a membrane (think of the membrane of a drum). By studying this in detail you will develop the intuition and the skills that will allow you to understand other wave phenomena later. We’ll come back to waves at the end of the part on Fluid Dynamics when we study waves on the surface of a fluid.\nPersonally I like studying vibrating strings because they are at the foundation of superstring theory. This is a “Theory of Everything” that posits that elementary particles are actually tiny strings, with different vibrational states corresponding to different elementary particles. As a Ph.D. student I showed how, if these strings move in certain higher-dimensional group supermanifolds, they behave like the elementary particles of our standard model of particle physics, including the chiral fermions. If we ignore the bit about group supermanifolds for the moment, the maths behind string theory is no more complicated than the maths we will discuss in this module and the partner module on quantum mechanics.\nWe consider a flexible, elastic string of linear density \\(\\rho\\) (mass per unit length), which undergoes small transverse vibrations. (For example, it can be a guitar string.) The transverse vibrations mean that the displacements of each small element of the string is perpendicular to its length. We assume that the string does not move longitudinally (i.e. parallel to its length). Let \\(y(x, t)\\) be its displacement from equilibrium position at time \\(t\\) and position \\(x\\) (see Fig. Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A string stretched in the \\(x\\)-direction and vibrating in the \\(y\\)-direction.\n\n\nThe string is sufficiently simple, that we can understand it by pure thought. We will derive from first principles a PDE that describes its motion (the wave equation) and then solve it for various initial conditions. I find it amazing that this is possible.\nTo achieve this mathematical understanding we will need to make several simplifications and approximations. For example, we neglect that the string is made up of lots of individual atoms and instead we will pretend that the mass is spread out continuously along the string. This is known as the continuum approximation and we will meet this again in the fluid dynamics.\nTo derive the equation of motion of the string we first need to discuss the force acting on it which we will do in the next section. Then in the section after that we can plug this into Newton’s second law and out pops the wave equation. Along the way we will make approximations that allow us to linearise the equations."

    "section": "1.2 Linearized tension force",
    "text": "1.2 Linearized tension force\nWe consider a small segment of the string between any two points \\(x\\) and at \\(x+\\delta x\\) as shown in Fig. Figure 1.2. We want to determine the force that is acting on this segment, so that we can later determine its motion using Newton’s second law. We will concentrate on only the tension force of the string and ignore less important effects like gravity, friction, or stiffness.\nWe assume that the tension force \\(\\boldsymbol{T}(x)\\) has constant magnitude throughout the string: \\(|\\boldsymbol{T}(x)|=T\\). However its direction varies along the string, because it always acts in the tangential direction. At interior points the tension force pulling to one side will balance that pulling in the other direction. The net tension force on the segment will thus be determined by the tension forces at its ends. We have drawn these forces schematically in Figure Figure 1.2 where we have also split them into their \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) components.\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: The tension forces acting on a segment of the string between \\(x\\) and \\(x+\\delta x\\).\n\n\nThe total force acting on the segment is \\[\\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{T}(x+\\delta x)-\\boldsymbol{T}(x). \\tag{1.1}\\] We first consider the \\(y\\) component \\[T_y(x) = T\\sin\\theta(x), \\tag{1.2}\\] where \\(\\theta(x)\\) is the angle that the string makes with the horizontal at \\(x\\). The slope of the string at \\(x\\) is \\[\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = \\tan\\theta(x). \\tag{1.3}\\] We are now going to simplify the expressions by assuming that the slope and thus \\(\\theta\\) is small, \\(\\theta<<1\\). Then, by Taylor expansion, \\[\\sin\\theta = \\theta + O(\\theta^3), ~~~\\tan\\theta = \\theta + O(\\theta^2). \\tag{1.4}\\] We ignore all terms that are higher order in \\(\\theta\\). This is known as the linear approximation. It is done very often, because it leads to linear equations that are so much easier to solve. So \\[\\begin{split}\nF_y&=T_y(x+\\delta x) - T_y(x) \\\\\n&= T\\sin\\theta(x+\\delta x) -T\\sin\\theta(x)\\\\\n&\\approx T\\left(\\theta(x+\\delta x)-\\theta(x)\\right).\n\\end{split} \\tag{1.5}\\] We do another Taylor expansion and ignore higher-order terms in \\(\\delta x\\), which is fine because we want to look at only an infinitesimally small segment of string. \\[\\begin{split}\\theta(x+\\delta x)&=\\theta(x)+\\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}+O(\\delta x)^2\\\\\n&\\approx \\theta(x)+\\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}.\\end{split} \\tag{1.6}\\] Substituting this into Eq. 1.5 gives \\[F_y\\approx T \\delta x\\frac{\\partial\\theta}{\\partial x}. \\tag{1.7}\\] We would like to express this in terms of \\(y\\) instead of \\(\\theta\\), which we can do by observing that \\[\\theta\\approx\\tan\\theta=\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x}, \\tag{1.8}\\] so we finally have \\[F_y\\approx T\\,\\delta x\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 y}{\\partial x^2}. \\tag{1.9}\\]\nWe deal with the \\(x\\) component of the force similarly, using the Taylor expansion of \\(\\cos\\theta=1+O(\\theta^2)\\): \\[\\begin{split}F_x&=T_x(x+\\delta x)-T_x(x)\\\\\n&=T\\cos\\theta(x+\\delta x)-T\\cos\\theta(x)\\\\\n&\\approx T-T=0.\\end{split} \\tag{1.10}\\] So in our approximation of small slope, there is no movement in the \\(x\\) direction. The string vibrates purely transversally."

This means that the vertical component of the tension force applied to the end of the string must be zero, which in turn means the string must be horizontal at \\(x\\), i.e., we have the boundary condition \\[\n\\partial_x y(0,t) =0~~~\\text{ for all }t\\in\\mathbb{R}.\n\\tag{3.6}\\] Conditions which specify the value of the normal derivative of the unknown function at the boundary are called Neumann conditions. So, here we have the homogeneous Neumann condition at \\(x=0\\). We now substitute the general solution. First we calculate its derivative \\[\\partial_x y(x,t)=f'(x-ct)+g'(x+ct) \\tag{3.7}\\] and thus the boundary condition says that \\[\\partial_x y(0,t)=f'(-ct)+g'(ct)=0~~~\\text{ for all }t\\in\\mathbb{R}. \\tag{3.8}\\] Integrating this gives \\[\\frac{-1}{c}f(-ct)+\\frac{1}{c}g(ct)=\\text{constant}. \\tag{3.9}\\] Changing the constant only moves the string up or down on the y axis.

    "text": "3.3 Reflection at a change of density\nConsider two semi-infinite strings joined at the origin. The string on the left (\\(x<0\\)) has constant density \\(\\rho_1\\) and the string on the right (\\(x>0\\)) has constant density \\(\\rho_2\\). Let \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) be the displacements of the two strings. Since the strings have different densities, the wave speed in the two strings will be different: \\[\nc_1=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\rho_1}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad\nc_2=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\rho_2}}.\n\\tag{3.12}\\] Suppose that we have a wave travelling to the right on the first string (an incident wave). When the wave meets the change in density, it will be partially reflected (back to the region \\(x<0\\)) and partially transmitted (forward to the region \\(x>0\\)). Waves travelling in the interval \\(x\\in(-\\infty,0)\\) are described by the wave equation with wave speed \\(c_1\\); waves travelling in the interval \\(x\\in(0,\\infty)\\) are described by the wave equation with wave speed \\(c_2\\). This is illustrated in Figure Figure 3.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: A right-moving wave being partially reflected and partially transmitted at the interface between two strings with wave velocities \\(c_1=1\\) (on the left half-line) and \\(c_2=2\\) (on the right half-line). Dashed line: incident right-moving wave. Solid line: wave interacting with the interface. Dashdotted line: partially reflected left-moving and partially transmitted right-moving wave.\n\n\nTherefore, we can write \\[\ny(x,t)=\\begin{cases}\ny_1(x,t)=f_I(x-c_1 t) + f_R(x+c_1 t), &x<0 \\\\\ny_2(x,t)=f_T(x-c_2 t), &x>0\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{3.13}\\] where \\(f_I\\), \\(f_R\\) and \\(f_T\\) represent the incident, reflected and transmitted waves, respectively. At the point of contact of the two strings (\\(x=0\\)), we impose the following two conditions: \\[\ny_1(0,t) = y_2(0,t) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ t,\n\\tag{3.14}\\] \\[\n\\partial_x y_1(0,t) = \\partial_x y_2(0,t) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ t.\n\\tag{3.15}\\] Condition 3.14 says that the solution for the combined string should be continuous at \\(x=0\\) (because the strings are attached to each other at the point). Condition 3.15 states that the slopes of the strings at \\(x=0\\) should be the same (if this is not so, there will be a finite force applied to an infinitesimal part of the combined string at \\(x=0\\), producing unphysical infinite acceleration).\nSuppose that the incident wave is given, i.e. the function of one variable \\(f_I\\) is known. Can we find \\(f_R\\) and \\(f_T\\)?\nSubstitution of Eq. 3.13 into condition Eq. 3.14 yields \\[\nf_I(-c_1 t) + f_R(c_1 t) = f_T(-c_2 t) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ t\n\\tag{3.16}\\] or equivalently (writing \\(s=c_1 t\\)) \\[\nf_I(-s) + f_R(s) = f_T\\left(-\\frac{c_2}{c_1} \\, s\\right) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ s .\n\\tag{3.17}\\] Similarly, on substituting Eq. 3.13 into condition Eq. 3.15, we find that \\[\nf_I'(-c_1 t) + f_R'(c_1 t) = f_T'(-c_2 t) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ t\n\\tag{3.18}\\] or \\[\nf_I'(-s) + f_R'(s) = f_T'\\left(-\\frac{c_2}{c_1} \\, s\\right) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ s.\n\\tag{3.19}\\] Integrating this equation in \\(s\\), we get \\[\n-f_I(-s) + f_R(s) = -\\frac{c_1}{c_2} \\, f_T\\left(-\\frac{c_2}{c_1} \\, s\\right) \\quad \\text{for all} \\ s .\n\\tag{3.20}\\] Eliminating \\(f_R(s)\\) from Eq. 3.17 and Eq. 3.20, we obtain \\[\n2f_I(-s) = \\left(1+\\frac{c_1}{c_2}\\right) \\, f_T\\left(-\\frac{c_2}{c_1} \\, s\\right) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ s .\n\\tag{3.21}\\] or, equivalently, \\[\nf_T(\\tilde{s}) = \\frac{2c_2}{c_2+c_1} \\, f_I\\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_2} \\, \\tilde{s}\\right) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ \\tilde{s}\n\\tag{3.22}\\] where \\(\\tilde{s}=-(c_2/c_1)s\\). Eq. 3.22 defines the function (of one variable) \\(f_T\\) in terms of known function \\(f_I\\).\nTo find \\(f_R\\), we substitute Eq. 3.22 into Eq. 3.17. This yields the formula \\[\nf_R(s) = \\frac{c_2-c_1}{c_2+c_1} \\, f_I\\left(- s\\right) \\quad \\text{for  all} \\ s.  \n\\tag{3.23}\\] Finally, on substituting Eq. 3.22 and Eq. 3.23 into Eq. 3.13, we get the solution formula \\[\ny(x,t)=\\begin{cases}\nf_I(x-c_1 t) +  A_R f_I(-x-c_1 t), &x<0 \\\\\nA_T f_I\\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_2}(x-c_2 t)\\right), &x>0\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{3.24}\\] where \\(A_R\\) (the ratio of the amplitude of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave) and \\(A_T\\) (the ratio of the amplitude of the transmitted wave to that of the incident wave) are given by \\[\n\\quad A_R=\\frac{c_2-c_1}{c_2+c_1}, \\quad\nA_T=\\frac{2c_2}{c_2+c_1}.\n\\tag{3.25}\\]\nTo check whether our answer makes sense, it is useful to consider a few limit cases.\n\nIf \\(\\rho_1=\\rho_2\\), then \\(c_1=c_2\\), and we have \\(A_R=0\\) and \\(A_T=1\\) (as one would expect for an infinite homogeneous string).\nIf \\(\\rho_1\\ll\\rho_2\\) (the first string is much lighter than the second one), then \\(c_1\\gg c_2\\), and we have \\(A_R\\approx -1\\) and \\(A_T=0\\) (so that the heavy string effectively arrests the displacement at \\(x=0\\) as if the right end of the first string was fixed).\nIf \\(\\rho_1\\gg\\rho_2\\) (the first string is much heavier than the second one), then \\(c_1\\ll c_2\\), and we have \\(A_R\\approx 1\\) and \\(A_T=2\\) (so that the light second string does not effect the displacement at \\(x=0\\) as if the right end of the first string was free).\n\n\n\n\n\nBaldock, G.

    "text": "4.3 Standing waves and superposition\nThe solutions we obtained in the previous section are standing waves. They don’t change their shape and don’t move, only their amplitude oscillates with time. In the lecture videos I make various sketches and animations to illustrate this.\nSo we now have a stark contrast between what d’Alembert found and what Bernoulli found. According to d’Alembert, the solutions of the wave equation are travelling waves of arbitrary shape. According to Bernoulli, the solutions are standing waves that have sine shape. It is always wonderful when one has two very different ways of looking at the same phenomenon. That is where deep understanding comes from.\nTo resolve the apparent conflict between d’Alembert’s solution and Bernoulli’s solution we have to use the superposition principle: For any set of linear homogeneous equations, any sum of solutions is also a solution.\nSince the wave equation is linear and also the boundary conditions we imposed were linear, a linear combination of any number of harmonic standing waves is also a solution. So, we can construct a general solution of the wave equation by summing up all 1 the harmonic standing waves from Eq. 4.11: \\[\ny(x,t) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\sin\\left(k x\\right)\\left(F_k \\, \\sin(k c t) + G_k \\, \\cos(k c t)\\right).\n\\tag{4.12}\\] Here the \\(G_k\\) and the \\(F_k\\) are undetermined constants, to be fixed from the initial conditions.1 We do not need negative \\(k\\) because they will produce the same solutions, and we do not need \\(k=0\\) because it yields zero solution. Also, we have absorbed the constant \\(A\\) into the constants \\(F_k\\) and \\(G_k\\).\nThe resolution of the apparent paradox is that a superposition of standing waves can give a travelling wave, and that a superposition of sine waves can give any shape."

Thus the potential energy in the infinitesimal segment of the string is \\[\n\\delta V=T\\left(\\delta s - \\delta x\\right)\n= \\frac{T}{2} \\left(\\partial_x y\\right)^2\\, \\delta x .\n\\tag{6.4}\\] Summing up contributions from all small elements of the string (i.e. integrating over the whole string), we find the potential energy \\[\nV=\\int T \\, \\frac{(\\partial_x y)^2}{2} \\, dx = \\int \\mathcal{E}_V\\,dx.\n\\tag{6.5}\\] The quantity \\(\\mathcal{E}_V\\) is the potential energy density.\nThe total energy \\(E\\) is the sum of the kinetic and potential energy: \\[\\begin{split}\nE&=K+V\\\\\n&=\\int \\left( \\frac{\\rho}{2}  (\\partial_t y)^2+  \\frac{T}{2} (\\partial_x y)^2\\right)  dx\\\\\n&= \\int \\mathcal{E}\\,dx,\n\\end{split} \\tag{6.6}\\] where \\(\\mathcal{E}=\\mathcal{E}_K + \\mathcal{E}_V\\) is the total energy density."

Similarly the flux at the right boundary is zero: \\[\n\\mathcal{F}(\\pi,t)=-T\\,\\partial_ty(\\pi,t)\\,\\partial_xy(\\pi,t)=0.\n\\tag{6.28}\\] So by the conservation equation it follows that the energy is conserved."

In the equilibrium state, it is flat and coincides with the \\((x,y)\\) plane in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). We assume that it is stretched to a tension \\(T\\) (force per unit length, measured in \\(N/m\\)). This means that for any line on the surface of the membrane, the part of the membrane on one side of the line exerts a force \\(T\\) (per unit length of the line) on the other part of the membrane (on the other side of the line), and the direction of the force is perpendicular to the line.\nThe perturbed membrane may be described as a time-dependent surface \\(z=z(x,y,t)\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\), where \\(z(x,y,t)\\) is the vertical (in the \\(z\\) direction) displacement of the membrane at point \\((x,y)\\) and time \\(t\\).

Almost the same arguments as those in Section 1.2 lead to the conclusion that the vertical component of the force is a sum of two terms: \\(T \\delta y \\, \\partial_x^2 z \\, \\delta x\\) (coming from the tension forces that are nearly parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis in Figure 7.1) and \\(T \\delta x \\, \\partial_y^2 z \\, \\delta y\\) (coming from the tension forces that are nearly parallel to the \\(y\\)-axis in Figure 7.1). So, Newton’s equation of motion (\\(ma=F\\)) yields \\[\n(\\rho \\, \\delta x \\, \\delta y)\\partial_t^2 z = T \\delta y \\, \\partial_x^2 z \\, \\delta x + T \\delta x \\, \\partial_y^2 z \\, \\delta y.\n\\tag{7.1}\\] Dividing this by \\(\\delta x \\, \\delta y\\) and \\(\\rho\\), we get the governing equation for the membrane: \\[\n\\partial_t^2 z = \\frac{T}{\\rho} \\left( \\partial_x^2 \\, z  +  \\partial_y^2 \\, z\\right)\n\\tag{7.2}\\] or, equivalently, \\[\n\\partial_t^2 z  - c^2 \\nabla^2 z = 0, \\quad c=\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\rho}}.\n\\tag{7.3}\\] Here \\(c\\) in the wave speed and \\(\\nabla^2\\) is the Laplace operator: \\[\n\\nabla^2= \\partial_x^2  + \\partial_y^2.\n\\tag{7.4}\\] Sometimes, the Laplace operator is also denoted by \\(\\Delta\\) (i.e. \\(\\Delta = \\nabla^2 = \\partial_x^2 + \\partial_y^2\\)).

As in section Section 4.1, we choose this constant to be negative and (for convenience) equal to \\(-k^2 c^2\\) (for arbitrary real \\(k\\)).
